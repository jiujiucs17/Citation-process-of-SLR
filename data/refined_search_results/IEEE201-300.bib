abstract={A cost expenditure of software defined radio software has limiting the development of cognitive radio in third countries. Moreover, a complexity of signal processing library in a SDR platform has contributed to the hard implementation in real applications. In this works, the development of SDR platform with low cost expenditure is proposed. Arduino UNO and X Bee uses for the OFDM based spectrum exchange information. In a case of spectrum sensing scenario, the objective of the local spectrum sensing is to detect the PU's signal detection. The performance of SN ability to sense the PU's signal is crucial. It was shown that from the previous works as the detected power is quantized into information bit is simulated. In order to implemented the spectrum exchange information during sensing, Arduino UNO and X Bee is implemented to sense the presence of PU activity channels of wifi terminals based on the energy of the signals. The detected power (RSSI) of wifi terminals is exchanged into an OFDM subcarrier tone signal such as orthogonal sub-channel that being equally divided from the licensed band. The results shows that using proposed software defined radio (SDR) based on Arduino and X Bee, the cognitive radio spectrum sensing is applied. The received power from the PU's channels such as wifi networks can be detected as well. The system could received and exchanged into OFDM-based subcarrier information bits.},

abstract={The object-oriented design community has recently begun to collect so-called design patterns: cliches plus hints to their recommended use in software construction. The structural design patterns Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, and Proxy represent packaged problem/context/solution/properties descriptions to common problems in object-oriented design. Localizing instances of these patterns in existing software produced without explicit use of patterns can improve the maintainability of software. In the authors' approach, called the Pat system, design information is extracted directly from C++ header files and stored in a repository. The patterns are expressed as PROLOG rules and the design information is translated into facts. A single PROLOG query is then used to search for all patterns. They examined four applications, including the popular class libraries zApp and LEDA, with Pat. With some restrictions all pattern instances are found; the precision is about 40 percent. Since manual filtering of the output is relatively easy, they consider Pat a useful tool for discovering or recovering design information.},

abstract={Efficient and precise simulation models at a high abstraction level are required in order to perform early design validations and architecture explorations of multi- processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) platforms. Although native software simulation approaches provide interesting capabilities, they quickly become unsuitable when complex hardware architecture have to be considered. In this paper, we present a SystemC-based MPSoC platform implementation that allows native software simulation while keeping details of the underlying hardware model. The key contribution of this work is a realistic memory mapping modelling that makes possible the simulation of operating systems and software applications on complex hardware models with multiple processors and DMA devices. This method also allows the reuse of different software components for the target processor(s). Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method to validate software on complex hardware architectures.},

title={Power of Enumeration -- BDD/ZDD-Based Techniques for Discrete Structure Manipulation},
year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={143-143},
abstract={Summary form only given. Discrete structures are foundational materials for computer science and mathematics, which are related to set theory, symbolic logic, inductive proof, graph theory, combinatorics, probability theory, etc. Many problems are decomposed into discrete structures using simple primitive algebraic operations. A Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) is a representation of a Boolean function, one of the most basic models of discrete structures. After the epoch-making paper [1] by Bryant in 1986, BDD-based methods have attracted a great deal of attention. The BDD was originally developed for the efficient Boolean function manipulation required in VLSI logic design, however, later they are also used for sets of combinations which represent many kinds of combinatorial patterns. A Zero-suppressed BDD (ZDD) [2] is a variant of the BDD, customized for representing a set of combinations. ZDDs have been successfully applied not only to VLSI design, but also for solving various combinatorial problems, such as constraint satisfaction, frequent pattern mining, and graph enumeration. Recently, ZDDs have become more widely known, since D. E. Knuth intensively discussed ZDD-based algorithms in the latest volume of his famous series of books [3]. Although a quarter of a century has passed since Bryant first put forth his idea, there are still many interesting and exciting research topics related to BDDs and ZDDs [4]. One of the most important topics would be that, Knuth presented an extremely fast algorithm "Simpath" [3] to construct a ZDD which enumerates all the paths connecting two points in a given graph structure. This work is important because many kinds of practical problems are efficiently solved by some variations of this algorithm. We generically call such ZDD construction methods "frontier-based methods." The above techniques of data structures and algorithms have been implemented and published as an open software library, named "Graphillion"[5], [6]. Graphillion is a library for manipulating very large sets of graphs, based on ZDDs and frontier-based method. Graphillion is implemented as a Python extension in C++, to encourage easy development of its applications without introducing significant performance overhead. In order to organize an integrated method of algebraic operations for manipulating various types of discrete structures, and to construct standard techniques for efficiently solving large-scale and practical problems in various fields, A governmental agency in Japan started a nation-wide project: ERATO MINATO Discrete Structure Manipulation System Project in 2009. The project was successfully finished in this year, and a successor project, JSPS KAKENHI(S), is now running until 2020. Many interesting research results were produced in the last ERATO project, and some of topics are still attractive to be explored more. In this talk, we first show an overview of our research project, and then explain the basic techniques of BDDs and ZDDs used for various discrete structure manipulation. We also present a brief history of the research activity related to BDDs and ZDDs. We then show an overview of the frontier-based method for efficiently enumerating and indexing the solutions of combinatorial problems. We also present several topics on various applications of those stateof- the-art techniques.},

abstract={Nowadays, by technology developments, software systems enlarge in scale and complexity. In large systems and to overcome complexity, software architecture has been considered as a connected notion with product quality and plays a crucial role in the quality of final system. The aim of the analysis of software architecture is to recognize potential risks and investigating qualitative needs of software design before the process of production and implementation. Achievement to this goal reduces the costs and improves the software quality. In this paper, a new approach is presented to evaluate performance of component-based software architecture for software systems with distributed architecture. In this approach, at first system is modeled as a Discrete Time Markov Chain and then the required parameters are taken from, to produce a Product Form Queueing Network. Limitations of source, like restrictions of the number of threads in a particular machine, are also regarded in the model. The prepared model is solved by the SHARPE software packages. As the result of the solution of the produced model in this approach, throughput and the average response time and bottlenecks in different workloads of system are predicted and some suggestions are presented to improve the system performance.},

The software is used to model and assess Printed Wiring Assembly and microelectronic designs. Tools include thermal analysis, vibrational analysis, solder joint fatigue assessment and plated-through hole assessment. In the field, the CALCE software has enjoyed dual use by both government and industry consortium members. In this paper, we present lessons learned in the successful implementation of software as a technology transfer vehicle. To this end, several case studies of industrial usage are presented. The following examples are included. Honeywell has used CALCE software to perform thermal assessments of a new cooling technology which could not be performed with existing software tools. AlliedSignal has integrated CALCE software into their Integrated Product Design System. Texas Instruments has incorporated software tools developed by the CALCE EPRC into their internally used Computer Aided Reliability and Maintainability Applications (CARMA) tool suite.

While many of these research projects have lead to exciting enhancements in our field, many other projects have failed to be adopted because of poor interface design or lack of integration with existing tools. Designing, building, integrating and evaluating interfaces is a challenge to software engineering researchers. In this paper we borrow from the field of model driven engineering (MDE) to assist with the creation of highly customizable interfaces for software visualization. MDE moves the level of abstraction from implementation to design, and help improve the efficiency of building software visualizations. By moving away from implementation details, and providing researchers with the ability to customize their visualizations in an efficient manner, software engineers have more resources to design and evaluate their ideas},

abstract={Fuzzy Logic Systems have been successfully used in a wide range of real-world problems.

Recently, the library Java Fuzzy Markup Language (JFML) offers a complete implementation of the standard, however, the actual version of the JFML does not support the development of fuzzy inference systems on specific types of hardware. The aim of this paper is to develop an interoperability module to design and running FLS for embedded systems in JFML, concretely for Arduino boards. In addition, a communication protocol between JFML and Arduino boards is also defined, removing the limited computing capacity usually offered by embedded systems. A case study with a wall-following fuzzy controller to manage a mobile robotic in two environments is developed in order to illustrate the potential of the new interoperability module.},

title={Handling Soft Error in Embedded Software for Networking System},

pages={25-28},
abstract={Single event upset (SEU) is a well known and documented phenomenon that affects electronic circuitry. These events are caused by either atmospheric neutrons or alpha particles emitted by trace impurities in the silicon processing and packaging materials. The error in device output or operation caused by SEU is called soft error. Soft error is not software defects, but instead refers to a hardware data corruption that does not involve permanent chip damage. Soft errors can lead to catastrophic failures for embedded system. Due to the nature of the soft error, it is almost impossible to prevent them. Based on the impact severity, the recommended handling is to detect and correct them, called mitigation methodologies. The mitigation strategies are implemented in embedded software for networking system. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for single-event upset (SEU) mitigation methodologies for networking system. To achieve this goal we start by defining the SEU mitigation strategy as a combination of chip level methods and system level handling methods. Given a particular SEU chip level or system level mitigation choice, we propose first categorizing the SEU Failure In Time (FIT) into different time window bins based on SEU recovery time. Then we analyze the impact of each mitigation strategy, results in the FIT value change in each bin. This framework enables the engineers to do the SEU mitigation design in early product development phase. A user-friendly Excel tool is also developed to make the complicated model easy to use. The embedded system like networking device can be modeled using the tool at an early stage to support design decisions and trade-offs related to potentially costly implementation.},

abstract={Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the direct application of information technology in the construction industry. It has many advantages such as shared API data interfaces, high data integration, data consistency, data relevance and construction demonstration functions. It has been widely used and achieved remarkable results. In the 21st century, the development trend of Beijing city is to develop towards the sky and underground. Especially in the past ten years, with the increase of high-rise and super high-rise buildings in Beijing, and the booming development of subway construction. The underground continuous wall is a construction technology with very high use value whether it is used as the main body (or part of the main body) of the underground structure or as a waterproof and soil retaining facility during construction. However, in the Beijing area, the underground diaphragm wall (depth greater than 40 meters, width greater than or equal to 1.2 meters) due to the difficulty of the project, complex technology, and many construction problems, the relevant design and construction experience is less, and the relevant technical talents are scarce. The purpose of this article is to study the application of BIM in underground continuous walls. This article is based on the Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 development platform, based on the Visual C# programming language, using the API data interface provided by the Revit 2018 software, based on the built BIM model, for engineering quantity statistics, collision checking, drawing output, collaborative work and construction models. Wait for operations to show the application of BIM technology in the underground continuous wall. Experiments show that the use of the collision detection function of BIM technology can not only reasonably arrange pipelines, but also adjust the positions of brackets, buttresses and other components to facilitate the on-site installation of pipelines. The use of BIM technology can simulate the hoisting of the pipe gallery, find out the collision points in the hoisting process, and improve the hoisting plan.},

abstract={Software faults are known as a major cause of computational systems' defects. Even when these systems are tested exhaustively they can present some failures due to the activation of residual software faults in the source code. Software fault injection tools are useful to emulate the presence of software faults and to monitor the system allowing one to observe if the system continues to operate as expected. A tool helps to evaluate the possible failures in order to define countermeasures to avoid them or to reduce their severity, increasing the levels of dependability of the application under test. This work presents the J-SWFIT tool, which emulates Java software faults directly in compiled code. The architecture of the tool was proposed in an abstract level that can be easily understood and extended. J-SWFIT works based on a set of predefined Java operators and consists of analyzing the byte codes of compiled Java files, finding locations where specific faults can exist and can be injected each one independently. J-SWFIT allows comparing the systems' behavior in the presence and absence of each fault.},

The control software yields very simple and it is demonstrated to be implementable on any general use microcontroller, with generic software functions from C-language or assembly libraries. Snippets of software routines are provided for a Microchip platform to illustrate their simplicity.

abstract={Substation ground system serves to safety of personnel and as major equipment during earth faults, which deserves considerable attentions. Basic substation safety assessment quantities include ground grid resistance, mesh touch potential and step potential, moreover, optimal design of substation ground system should consider both safeness and cost. To fill the lack of such suitable and economical optimal design software in North American industry, a software package coded in MATLAB is developed and its core algorithm and main features are introduced in this paper. A novel hybrid GA-PS optimization or two-steps optimization method is developed, in which Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used firstly to search an approximate start point range for the further optimal searching, followed by Pattern Search (PS) to find the final optimal result. This software can give analysis of ground grid safety performance and is able to recommend optimal grid design for given safety constraints. In order to make sure the accuracy of this software, the results of grid safety assessment obtained here are also compared with the results calculated by using worldwide used software WinIGS.},

abstract={Transactional Memory (TM) is a new programming paradigm that offers an alternative to traditional lock-based concurrency mechanisms. It offers a higher-level programming interface and promises to greatly simplify the development of correct concurrent applications on multicore architectures. However, simplicity often comes with an important performance deterioration and given the variety of TM implementations it is still a challenge to know what kind of applications can really take advantage of TM. In order to gain some insight on these issues, helping developers to understand and improve the performance of TM applications, we propose a generic approach for collecting and tracing relevant information about transactions. Our solution can be applied to different Software Transactional Memory (STM) libraries and applications as it does not modify neither the target application nor the STM library source codes. We show that the collected information can be helpful in order to comprehend the performance of TM applications.},

abstract={With the present trend of multi-function and minimizing of size, the conventional electronic package type no longer meets the requirement of the new-generation products. Consequently, new type packaging, based on the wafer level packages (WLP) and chip scale packages (CSP) technology are being developed to achieve these requirements, as well as long term reliability. Novel wafer-level chip scale packages (WLCSP) with a stress buffer layer and bubble-like plate are proposed in this research to improve the solder joint fatigue life. The thermal stress caused by the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch can be significantly reduced, and the reliability of the WLP could be substantially enhanced by this new design. In order to realize the relationship of the solder joint fatigue life, stress buffer layer and bubble-like plate, a finite element parametric analysis applying software ANSYS/sup /spl reg// is utilized. The design parameters include the thickness of the stress buffer layer, thickness, bending angle and standoff height of the different types of bubble-like plate. The results of the finite element method (FEM) analysis reveal that the stress buffer layer and bubble-like plate can relax the thermal stresses of solder joints and enhance the package reliability. In addition, the peeling stress between stress buffer layer and two different types of bubble-like plates is discussed, and the stress state of the leadframe is also analyzed in this research. Furthermore, the findings of this research can be used as the guideline for advanced WLCSP design.},

The degree of freedom is just 1, so the determinate drive motion can be actualized. The transmission ratio is higher than K-H-V planetary gear transmission, so it has higher deceleration and acceleration performances. According to the structural characteristics of designed internal translation gear transmission, the man-machine interactive CAD system was developed by using VC++ platform, Pro/ENGINEER and Pro/TOOLKIT software package.

abstract={The paper proposes modeling of a volumetric multilayer shell structure that covers the surface of a agriculture robotic device. The shell in the first version can take shape due to its own gravity and the elasticity of its materials for bending, provided its position is fixed along the upper boundary. Below the boundary of the attachment, the shell is free. A variational problem is posed to determine the shape of such a shell. In the second version, the shell structure takes shape due to the air injected into the shell. Design of a shell that mimics the shape of a human body is proposed. To describe the shape of the shell, analytical dependencies were obtained and a computer program was developed for its visualization. Thin materials with conventional bending stiffness are considered as assembly structural elements: composite materials, fabrics, flexible boards, conductive threads and other built-in flexible electronic devices. A description of the volumetric shape of the shell structure and its visualization may be necessary for solving various problems both in agriculture and for the design of shell structures in medicine, construction, in the automotive, manufacturing, food and other industries.},

abstract={Software is the cornerstone of the modern society. Many human activities rely on software systems that shall operate seamlessly 24/7, and failures in such systems may cause severe problems and considerable economic loss. To efficiently address a growing variety of increasingly complex activities, software systems rely on sophisticated technologies. Most software systems are assembled from modules and subsystems that are often developed by third party organization, and sometime are not even available at the system build time. This is the case for example of many Web applications that link Web services built and changed independently by third party organizations while the Web applications are running. The progresses of software engineering in the last decades have increased the productivity, reduced the costs and improved the reliability of software products, but have not eliminated the occurrence of field failures. Detecting and removing all faults before deployment is practically too expensive even for systems that are simple and fully available at design time, and impossible when systems are large and complex, and are dynamically linked to modules that may be developed and distributed only after the deployment of the system. The classic stop-and-go maintenance approaches that locate and fix field faults offline before deploying new system versions are important, but not sufficient to guarantee a seamless 24/7 behavior, because the faulty systems remain in operation until the faults have been removed and new systems redeployed [1]. On the other hand, classic fault tolerant approaches that constrain developers' freedom and rely on expensive mechanisms to avoid or mask faults do not match the cost requirements of many modern systems, and do not extend beyond the set of safety critical systems [2]. Self-healing systems and autonomic computing tackle these new challenges by moving activities from design to runtime. In self-healing systems, the borderline between design and runtime activities fades, and both design and maintenance activities must change to enable activities such as fault diagnoses and fixes to be performed fully automatically and at runtime. Maintenance activities rely on information that are usually available at design time are are not part of the system runtime infrastructure. For example, corrective maintenance requires some knowledge about the expected system behavior to locate and fix the faults, while adaptive and perfective maintenance requires some knowledge about libraries and components to identify new modules that better cope with the the changes in the requirements and in the environment. In classic maintenance approaches, this knowledge is mastered by the developers, who gather and use the required information offline to deal with the emerging maintenance problems. In self healing systems the knowledge required for maintenance activities shall be available at runtime. Self healing systems shall be designed with enough embedded knowledge to deal with unplanned events, and shall be able to exploit this information automatically and at runtime to recover from unexpected situations, like field failures. The challenges of designing powerful self-healing systems relies in the ability to minimize the amount of extra knowledge to be provided at design time, while feeding a powerful automatic recovery mechanism. An interesting approach relies on the observation that software systems are redundant by nature, and exploits the intrinsic redundancy of software system to fix faults, thus minimizing the extra effort required at design time to feed the self-healing mechanism [3]. The intrinsic redundancy of software stems from design and reusability practice: the reuse of libraries may results in different ways to achieve the same or similar results, the design for modularity may produce methods with equivalent behavior, backward compatibility may keep deprecated and new implementations in the same system. For example, libraries like Ant and Log4J implement several functionalities already available in the standard Java libraries to improve efficiency or usability, while graphical libraries, like SWT, Swing and AWT, provide overlapping functionality that may be available in systems that include two or more of these libraries. This redundancy is available for free at runtime, and can be exploited both to design self-healing mechanisms that can be automatically activated to solve faulty situations at runtime, and to improve maintenance mechanisms by facilitating failure reproduction and fault localization and fixing.},

However most of the commercial MRI machines lack the provision to add new sequences developed by the academic/research community. An innovative design wherein the newly developed pulses sequences are seamlessly integrated into the machine with due validation and registration and also without affecting the major software workflow is one of the key features of the software platform. Open source interfaces has been adopted for the interface communication framework development so that the pulse sequences can be integrated with MRI machines vendor independently. This open-standard based software environment helps in implementing and applying MR pulse sequences to clinical scanners from different vendors. Using this software the new pulse sequences developed by academic/research community can be directly validated and tested using the main MRI software in the different commercially available MRI scanners. This provides opportunity for easily utilizing the state-of-the-art domain expertise available for implementation of pulse sequences which can directly be played in MRI scanner using this software architecture.},

abstract={Utilization of renewable energy resources is currently a global concern due to several reasons that include environmental pollution caused by combustion of conventional fuels, availability of resources in the vicinity, and continuous increase in cost of conventional fuels. Solar energy is the major renewable energy resource that is a basis for the other ones. Since the annual average daily radiation for Ethiopia is 5.2kWh/m2/day and the minimum annual average radiation ranges from 4.5kWh/m2/day in July to a maximum of 5.55kWh/m2/day in February and March [1], [2], parabolic trough collector solar power plants, which are mature technologies among the solar thermal ones, can be feasible to be used in the country for large and small scale applications. An interactive simulation software has been developed by the authors to support designers and researchers who are willing to simulate flow dynamics and power prediction of parabolic trough solar power plants and optimisation of their components. The design of the software began from thorough understanding of the physics governing conversion of energy from solar radiation to electricity using the plant, sizing of plant components, code writing for solving the governing equations and designing an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy communication with the software. Besides giving the basic fuction of simulation and optimisation, the software benefits its users in being freely accessible and open source. The open sourceness of the software package also moitvates others in the energy field to develop their own packages either by modifying the code of this software or by creating a new one. Furthermore, it is a unique method of mapping and identifying conducive environmental localities that are suitable for implementation of solar energy. Over and above this, this project is a unique means of sharing global responsibility of mitigating effect of climate change. The software has been validated by simulating existing power plants for which all the data are available.},

abstract={One of the key challenges in three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging is to enable the fast turn-around time, which is often required for interactive or real-time response. This inevitably requires not only high computational power but also high memory bandwidth due to the massive amount of data that need to be processed. In this work, we have developed a software platform that is designed to support high-performance 3D medical image processing for a wide range of applications using increasingly available and affordable commodity computing systems: multi-core, clusters, and cloud computing systems. To achieve scalable, high-performance computing, our platform (1) employs size-adaptive, distributable block volumes as a core data structure for efficient parallelization of a wide range of 3D image processing algorithms; (2) supports task scheduling for efficient load distribution and balancing; and (3) consists of a layered parallel software libraries that allow a wide range of medical applications to share the same functionalities. We evaluated the performance of our platform by applying it to an electronic cleansing system in virtual colonoscopy, with initial experimental results showing a 10 times performance improvement on an 8-core workstation over the original sequential implementation of the system.},

SDC's software development approach included the first time use of an off-the-shelf operating system for a major air defense system, the application of a selective set of modern software development techniques, and use of a matrix management structure. SDC's successful application on ADS of a commercial operating system, a higher order language, a Program Design Language, a Program Production Library, structured walk-throughs, structured programming techniques, incremental build implementation and testprocedures, interactive development, and word processing is described. A discussion of the advantages realized and difficulties encountered in the ADS matrix management structure is presented. The paper concludes with a summary of how SDC will develop software on future projects as a result of its experience on ADS.},

abstract={Architectures of implemented software systems tend to drift and erode as they are maintained and evolved. To properly understand such systems, their architectures must be recovered from implementation-level artifacts. Many techniques for architectural recovery have been proposed, but their degrees of automation and accuracy remain unsatisfactory. To alleviate these shortcomings, we present a machine learning-based technique for recovering an architectural view containing a system's components and connectors. Our approach differs from other architectural recovery work in that we rely on recovered software concerns to help identify components and connectors. A concern is a software system's role, responsibility, concept, or purpose. We posit that, by recovering concerns, we can improve the correctness of recovered components, increase the automation of connector recovery, and provide more comprehensible representations of architectures.},

abstract={The developers of a system are accepted as one of the most important stakeholders of an architecture description. The development viewpoint is suggested to satisfy the needs of the developers throughout the development process via codeline organization descriptions, programming models, etc. However, the available models for such purposes, if any, barely cross informal natural language descriptions and checklists. This paper introduces the idea of enhancing the description of the development viewpoint using lightweight domain-specific languages and presents the application of such languages in two industrial case studies. This language enables the architect to provide the necessary guidelines that constrains the implementers during the development process and it is also used as a means to discover the deviation of the code from the architecture as the development goes on.},

abstract={The design complexity and power consumption of hardware cache coherence logic increase considerably with the increase in number of cores. Although skipping coherence can simplify hardware and make it more power-efficient, programming becomes more challenging as programmers have to manually insert DMA instructions to ensure that there is coherence of shared data between cores. To reduce the burden of parallel programming, we propose program transformations and a runtime library that will enable correct execution of data-race-free multi-threaded programs. Our scheme manages coherence at byte granularity rather than conventional page-granularity. We further optimize the performance by introducing the concept of private write notice for each core and combining write notices in our coherence implementation. Experimental results of running multi-threaded signal processing benchmarks on the 8-core non-cache coherent Texas Instruments processor TMS320C6678 demonstrates that our technique achieves 12X performance improvement over naive scheme of disabling caches, and 2X performance improvement over the state-of-art technique.},

abstract={Polymer membrane roofs are efficient building constructions which fully comply with the concept of sustainable development. They are architecturally impressive and recyclable. Design omissions and deterioration of the structural elements with time, however, are significant issues. They require training competent specialists to be fixed and mitigated. The following fault analysis skills are considered in the present paper: identifying features which indicate the structural failure, tracking failure propagation throughout the membrane, detecting anomalies in the behavior of the building constructions using artificial neural networks. Fault analysis skills imply teamwork, rather than standalone personal activity. They contribute to firm development of soft skills of the researchers and stimulate using high-level open source software libraries for artificial intelligence applications. Development of fault analysis skills helps the researcher and the project manager to gain an insight into the structural behavior of deteriorated building constructions. It facilitates engineering of preventive measures for avoiding serious damages or even structural collapse.},

abstract={Nowadays, a typical software development process involves many developers which participate in the development process by using a wide variety of development tools. As a consequence, the data representing the project as a whole is distributed over different development tools. For the purpose of consistency, maintainability, and traceability it is an essential task to be aware of the relationships between semantic equivalent data in different tool repositories. The Real-Time Systems Lab at the Technische Universität Darmstadt performs research in the area of tool and metamodel integration to provide solutions to overcome this gap. In this demonstration we present the metamodeling framework MOFLON that addresses these issues by bringing together the latest OMG standards with graph transformations and triple graph grammars. Using MOFLON, developers can generate code for specific tools needed to perform analysis and transformation on one development tool or to incrementally integrate data of different modeling tools.},

year={2011},
volume={},

pages={229-238},
abstract={In the long-term evolution of software systems, various maintenance activities such as functionality extension, bug fixing, refactoring may positively or negatively affect the quality of design and implementation. The trend of quality degradation caused by negative affections may accumulate and cause serious difficulties for future maintenance of the software if they were not addressed properly in time. In this paper, we propose an approach for monitoring the degradation trends of software design in evolution and providing useful feedbacks for evolution decisions. The approach is based on the assumption that the deviations between different modularity views and their trends in evolution can be used to monitor the degradation trends of design. Currently, our approach considers three modularity views, namely package view, structural cluster view and semantic cluster view. Package view denotes the package structure reflecting the desired modularity view, Structural cluster view and semantic cluster view are the modularity views extracted from implementation by software clustering based on formal information and non-formal information, respectively. Then based on the three modularity views extracted from each version, our approach calculates the similarity between different views as the measurement of modularity deviations, and analyzes the deviation trends over a series of versions. We conduct an empirical study on three open-source systems, which confirms that continuous monitoring of deviation trends of modularity views can provide useful feedbacks for future evolution decisions.},

abstract={In this ubiquitous IoT (Internet of Things) era, web services have become a vital part of today's critical national and public sector infrastructure. With the industry wide adaptation of service-oriented architecture (SOA), web services have become an integral component of enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges. Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant. In this paper we provide an overview of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis techniques to discover these vulnerabilities. The paper reviews the security issues targeting web services, software/program verification and security development lifecycle.},

abstract={Software is continuously evolving as business processes that needed to be solved become increasingly complex. Software architecture is an important aspect during software design, with monolithic and microservices being two of the most common with their own advantages and disadvantages. Monolithic is a unified system with a relatively fast development time. Meanwhile, microservices facilitates low coupling and high cohesion, prioritizing maintenance, and ease of modification post-development. This research compares microservices and monolithic API-based thesis monitoring systems. Implementations are done using PHP, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Heroku. Reliability evaluations are done through automated tests with Apache JMeter. Metrics used are maturity, availability, fault tolerance, and recoverability based on the ISO/IEC 25010 reliability quality characteristics. The conclusion section showed that microservices are more reliable than the monolithic by demonstrating much better fault tolerance and recoverability, with comparable maturity and availability.},

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={90-93},
abstract={The MIT iLab architecture (consisting of Lab Servers and Service Brokers) was designed in the 1990's and while the Lab Server was designed as a software service the same architectural approach was not adopted for the Service Broker. This paper reports on a redesign of the Service Broker as a software service, which is itself a collection of software services. In the process of this redesign it was decided to examine the API on the Lab Server and to support not only the existing Lab Server API (to maintain support for all existing iLab Lab Servers) but to concurrently support an alternative lightweight API based upon a RESTful architecture and to use JSON to encode the data. As these changes required a complete rewrite of the Service Broker code base, it was decided to experiment with an implementation of the services using Node.js - a popular approach to the implementation of servers in Javascript. The intention was to open up the code base to code developers normally associated with web development and not normally associated with the development of remote laboratories. A new software service named an “agent” was developed that wraps around the service broker to allow programmable modification of requests. The agent also has the ability to serve up an interface to user clients. The use of agents has advantages over existing implementations because it allows customised authentication schemes (such as OAuth) as well as providing different user groups with unique Lab Clients to the same Lab Servers. Lab Clients no longer are served up through the Service Broker, but can reside anywhere on the Internet and access the Service Broker via access to a suitable agent. One outcome of these architectural changes has been the introduction of a simple integration of a remote laboratory in the Blackboard Learning Management System (LMS) using a Learning Tool Interoperability (LTI) module for user authentication.},

abstract={With the advent of chip-multiprocessors, we are faced with the challenge of parallelizing performance-critical software. Transactional memory (TM) has emerged as a promising programming model allowing programmers to focus on parallelism rather than maintaining correctness and avoiding deadlock. Many implementations of hardware, software, and hybrid support for TM have been proposed; of these, software-only implementations (STMs) are especially compelling since they can be used with current commodity hardware. However, in addition to higher overheads, many existing STM systems are limited to either managed languages or intrusive APIs. Furthermore, transactions in STMs cannot normally contain calls to unobservable code such as shared libraries or system calls. In this paper we present JudoSTM, a novel dynamic binary-rewriting approach to implementing STM that supports C and C++ code. Furthermore, by using value-based conflict detection, JudoSTM additionally supports the transactional execution of both (i) irreversible system calls and (ii) library functions that may contain locks. We significantly lower overhead through several novel optimizations that improve the quality of rewritten code and reduce the cost of conflict detection and buffering. We show that our approach performs comparably to Rochester's RSTM library-based implementation- demonstrating that a dynamic binary-rewriting approach to implementing STM is an interesting alternative.},

abstract={Magic state manager (MASM) is recently developed software architecture for completely transparent checkpointing/recovery in support of optimistic synchronization in the high level architecture. In the original design, MASM relies on: (i) user level machine dependent modules; (ii) patches for specific versions of the LINUX kernel; and (iii) static linking of specific application libraries, all of them required for performing ad-hoc, low level memory management operations associated with optimistic synchronization requirements. In this paper, we propose a complete re-engineering of this software architecture which allows all those memory management tasks to be carried out through user level, machine independent modules, with the additional advantage of avoiding the need for static linking of specific application libraries, thus achieving portability of MASM across different UNIX systems and different computer architectures.},

This platform provides the unique opportunity of making the entire system (installed on a server PC) available to external users (small factories concurring to the shoe production chain), without the need of a CAD software own installation. The scenario in which the described system is supposed to work consists of a inter-company network with a main node equipped with the web-CAD platform. This main node acts as a server towards the peripheral nodes (clients: shoe assembly and component-making companies).},

In addition, APAP shows detailed data flow which makes it easy for the student to envision exactly how the pipeline works. The main simulation process used follows five major steps: construction of the arithmetic pipeline, specification of pipeline connections, definition of the reservation table, definition of the input data, and calculation and presentation of data flow.

abstract={As new applications in embedded communications and control systems push the computational limits of digital signal processing (DSP) functions, there will be an increasing need for software applications to be migrated to hardware in the form of a hardware-software codesign system. In many cases, access to the high-level source code may not be available. It is thus desirable to have a technology to translate the software binaries intended for processors to hardware implementations. This paper provides details on the retargetable FREEDOM compiler. The compiler automatically translates DSP software binaries to register-transfer level (RTL) VHDL and Verilog for implementation on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) as standalone or system-on-chip implementations. We describe the underlying optimizations and some novel algorithms for alias analysis, data dependency analysis, memory optimizations, procedure call recovery, and back-end code scheduling. Experimental results on resource usage and performance are shown for several program binaries intended for the Texas Instruments C 6211 DSP (VLIW) and the ARM 922 T reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processors. Implementation results for four kernels from the Simulink demo library and others from commonly used DSP applications, such as MPEG-4, Viterbi, and JPEG are also discussed. The compiler generated RTL code is mapped to Xilinx Virtex II and Altera Stratix FPGAs. We record overall performance gains of 1.5-26.9 for the hardware implementations of the kernels. Comparisons with the power aware compiler techniques (PACT) high-level synthesis compiler are used to show that software binaries can be used as intermediate representations from any high-level language and generate efficient hardware implementations.},

abstract={Flexibility is recognized as a key feature in structuring software, and many architectures have been designed to that effect. However, they often come with performance and code size overhead, resulting in a flexibility vs. efficiency dilemma. The source of inefficiency in software architectures can be identified in the data and control integration of components, because flexibility is present not only at the design level but also in the implementation. We propose the use of program specialization in software engineering as a systematic way to improve performance and in some cases, to reduce program size. In particular, we advocate the use of partial evaluation, which is an automatic technique to produce efficient, specialized instances of generic programs. We study several representative, flexible mechanisms found in software architectures: selective broadcast, pattern matching, interpreters, layers, and generic libraries. We show how partial evaluation can systematically be applied in order to optimize those mechanisms.},

The module-based design of the Thorvald II platform allows for rapid design and construction of robots that can operate in various environments, such as open fields, greenhouses, and polytunnels. Modules can be put together in arbitrary configurations, and it is important that this modularity is supported by the robot's software. The presented approach allows for quick setup of module communication, kinematic modeling and odometry for arbitrary Thorvald II hardware configurations. It speeds up the process of creating new configurations of the robot, as new configurations will not require configuration-specific alterations to the robot's code. The approach also allows us to quickly rebuild robots, which means that they can be adapted to new environments, fast and efficiently. We verify the presented approach through a field experiment, and discuss further development. We also provide instructions on how to install ROS packages presented in this paper.},

It serves as the transport layer of a protocol stack with Internet Protocol multicast, and has been demonstrated to support distributed simulation with significantly lower demands on the network than that generated by use of multiple TCP connections. We address the iterative design and prototyping process used to develop the current implementation of SRMP. We begin with a review of the principles involved in SRMP. We then focus on two major aspects of the SRMP implementation software design, inter-process communication and process concurrency (threading), which were developed using an iterative or spiral development model. The earliest prototypes we developed showed disappointingly poor performance. Inter-process communication went through three distinct iterations before arriving at an efficient implementation; threading required two iterations for the basic SRMP functionality, and a third for implementation of heartbeats and bundling. We describe how the iterative development process has produced an efficient and effective implementation, and can be expected to yield similar results with ongoing enhancements to SRMP.},

abstract={Component-based development is an architecture-centric process that relies on the integration of pre-fabricated software components. These are often blackbox components whose functionality and configuration may not match the “ideal” system architecture. Systematic architectural analysis can help ensure that risks resulting from architectural adaptations and trade-offs do not adversely affect critical system qualities (e.g. performance, security and modifiability). However, architectural analysis is a complex activity that involves planning, analysis, negotiation and assessment of large amounts of interrelated, often conflicting information. Good tool support is therefore essential for effective architectural analysis. However, the success of a tool depended not only on powerful analysis methods but also on the quality of the toolset's usability. This paper presents functional and non-functional requirements of the tool's user interface, and discusses the HCI design principles and guidelines in designing a high-quality user interface that would allow developers to parse, analyse and modify architecture specification easily and effectively.},

abstract={Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the era of data science and machine learning, especially for its diverse libraries and extension modules. Python front-end with C/C++ native implementation achieves both productivity and performance, almost becoming the standard structure for many mainstream software systems. However, feature discrepancies between two languages can pose many security hazards in the interface layer using the Python/C API. In this paper, we applied static analysis to reveal the evolution and usage statistics of the Python/C API, and provided a summary and classification of its 10 bug patterns with empirical bug instances from Pillow, a widely used Python imaging library. Our toolchain can be easily extended to access different types of syntactic bug-finding checkers. And our systematical taxonomy to classify bugs can guide the construction of more highly automated and high-precision bug-finding tools.},

abstract={Reliability belongs to key characteristics of most technical, as well as, non-technical systems. Therefore, its evaluation should be one of the principal skills of graduates of technically oriented study programs, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer engineering, or informatics. However, analysis of system reliability is a challenging task, especially in case of systems composed of many components. Main issues in this case are efficient representation of the system and fast computation of basic reliability characteristics, such as availability of the system or importance of the system components. The first issue can be solved by using special data structures and the second one by implementation of existing algorithms using these data structures. A Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) is one of the most prospective data structures that can be used for this purpose. It is a graph structure that allows representing Boolean functions in an efficient way. In reliability analysis, it can be used to represent structure of the system. However, manipulation with bigger BDDs and their application in computation of basic reliability indices usually requires good computer support in a form of specific software tool. The core of such a software tool should be a software library implementing operations that allows fast manipulation with BDDs. In this paper, we present one such library. The library is primarily intended for the development of software tools for reliability analysis of complex systems based on BDDs, and it will also be used as a support tool within practical classes of a course on reliability engineering that is taught at the Faculty of Management Science and Informatics of University of Zilina.},

year={2007},

pages={342-345},
abstract={In recent years, miniaturization, lightening, high performance, high reliability and low cost have been demanded intensely for electronic products, especially in the rapid growth of portable cell phone domain. Furthermore, multiple functional demand induces advanced package developments, such as system-on-chip (SoC) and system-in-package (SiP). System-on-chip (SoC) is an ideal package to integrate multiple functionalities in the chip level. However, the design and testing are very difficult, high cost and low manufacturing yield, these reasons drives multiple functional integration technology toward system-in-package (SiP) development gradually. Package-on-package (PoP) is a multi-package stacking structure of the TFBGA onto a BGA top that aims to reduce the placement and routing areas on board. This paper would introduce a new BGA structure with cavity for die placement and encapsulated by glob top as below illustration (figure 1). Unlike the regular PBGA as POP bottom package with the constraint of solder ball height, the package Cavity BGA would be more flexible The Cavity BGA package has some other benefits such as the use of glob top to get rid of spending specific molding compound tooling cost and less warpage issue. The warpage performance and glob top material properties are closely related. The warpage Improvement criteria for glob top material properties are concerned and provided in the paper. This study is to investigate the Cavity BGA packages warpage performance improvement and stress characteristic analyses as various liquid compound materials. The 3D finite element models using were commercial software ANSYS 9.0 constructed to analyze the warpage and stresses of the Cavity BGA packages. For bottom warpage simulation, 15×15 mm2 Cavity BGA with die size of 9.9×9.6mm2 and thickness of 75μm are utilized and the thermal loading was performed from 175 to 25 . Four kinds of glob top materials were utilized in bottom warpage simulation. The warpage performance of the package would be decided by glob top material properties such as glass transition temperature (Tg), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young’s modulus (E). Besides, the geometry dimension designs of package structure would have effects on warpage performance. They include die size, die thickness, core thickness, solder mask thickness, glob top thickness, and number of substrate. The foregoing various parameter effects on bottom warpage would have discussion in the paper. For Stress Characteristic issue, ball stress comparison with various TFBGA die size and TFBGA die stacking number are contained. The studies conclude that the Cavity BGA with liquid compound (higher Tg= 135 ) generates the smallest bottom warpage (6.5mil), since higher Tg causes smaller warpage. When the core thickness of Cavity BGA increases from 60μm to 100μm, the bottom warpage improves 10%. The Cavity BGA with 6 layers substrate generates bottom warpage 25% smaller than that with 4 layers. For warpage improvement of glob top properties, the simulation analyses demonstrated the high Tg is prefered to acquire the better warpage performance. The properties beyond Tg effect on warpage performance can be neglected within a specific range adjustment. The further direction would recommend with (1) higher CTE before Tg, (2) higher Young’s modulus before Tg, (3) higher Tg. Also, the positions of the ball stress concentration and higher ball crack risk will be presented and discussed in the paper. The influences of the structure designs and material property options on the warpage behavior are investigated to establish useful design guidelines.},

number={1},
pages={1812-1826},
abstract={Radiative transfer is a key component in almost all astrophysical and cosmological simulations. We present magritte: a modern open-source software library for 3D radiative transfer. It uses a deterministic ray-tracer and formal solver, i.e. it computes the radiation field by tracing rays through the model and solving the radiative transfer equation in its second-order form along a fixed set of rays originating from each point. magritte can handle structured and unstructured input meshes, as well as smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) particle data. In this first paper, we describe the numerical implementation, semi-analytic tests and cross-code benchmarks for the non-LTE line radiative transfer module of magritte. This module uses the radiative transfer solver to self-consistently determine the populations of the quantized energy levels of atoms and molecules using an accelerated Lambda iteration (ALI) scheme. We compare magritte with the established radiative transfer solvers ratran (1D) and lime (3D) on the van Zadelhoff benchmark and present a first application to a simple Keplerian disc model. Comparing with lime, we conclude that magritte produces more accurate and more precise results, especially at high optical depth, and that it is faster.},

abstract={Three problems limit neural network simulation environments. First, the computational complexity of neural network simulation imposes a practical constraint on the size of simulated neural networks. Second, neural network simulation environments are usually designed to accommodate a confined set of neural network models. Third, most neural network simulation environments do not facilitate interoperability with external systems. This project addresses these issues by implementing a simulation environment that scales to support larger neural systems, facilitates the implementation of new network architectures, and interoperates with other software. This problem was approached by examining a representative set of neural network architectures that feature a diversity of characteristics such as topology and learning rules. The result of this research was applied to the design and implementation of an environment consisting of tools and applications to support neural network simulation. This environment, developed under the Khoros system, provides a visual neural network construction tool, an extensible C++ class library that encapsulates network management and object interaction, a file format for storage and retrieval of neural networks, and finally, neural network visualization tools.},

abstract={Modern digital technologies give us great possibilities to organize knowledge about constructions, regarding multidisciplinary fields like preservation, conservation and valorization of our architectural heritage, in order to suggest restoration projects and related work, or to suppose a planned preventive maintenance. New procedures to archive, analyze and manage architectural information find a natural support in 3D model, thanks to the development of capacities of new modeling software. Moreover, if the model contains or interfaces with a heterogeneous archive of information, as it is for BIM, this model can be considered as the bases of critical studies, projects of restoration, heritage maintenance, integrated management, protection, and valorization, and evaluation of economic aspects, management and planning, that can flow into a planned preventive maintenance [1]. The aspect that limit the use of BIM technology is the set up parametric object library inside programs: the standardized level of these objects deals difficulty with survey and restoration issues, where each single element has its own historical and architectural characterization [2]. From this foreword, the goal of this research is more evident: the possibilities of using BIM modeling to the existing constructions and cultural heritage, as a support for the construction and management of a Plan for planned preventive maintenance.},

abstract={Software defined radios (SDR) requires an application-specific programmable architecture with instruction set targeted toward wireless baseband processing. Enabling this in handhelds terminal asks for both energy-awareness and cost-effectiveness. Micro-architecture efficiency and software mapping productivity must be carefully balanced. Especially in exploiting data-level parallelism, one has to trade off explicit, user-defined subword parallelism and automated, compiler-driven instruction level parallelism. In this paper, we describe an extensive exploration of a scalable subword-parallelism-enabled very long instruction word architecture targeting 100 Mbps SDRs. Coware LISATek tools is used to model a VLIW processor with scalable number of SIMD units. A compilation flow is set up supporting advanced ILP scheduling and subword parallelism encapsulation through intrinsic functions. Based on a set of representative SDR benchmarks, application specific optimization is carried out introducing powerful instruction set extensions. Cost and benefits are evaluated in terms of benchmark execution time and energy. Therefore, RTL is generated from LISATek and synthesized using a 90 nm CMOS library. By varying the architecture and technology parameters the optimal energy-performance tradeoff is derived. The achieved performance is more than sufficient for SISO WLAN such as 802.11 a/g},

abstract={The manual creation of complex 3D structures for use in engineering analysis is a major obstacle to analyzing physically realistic structures. A bias is invariably imposed when a mixture is manually composed, and the structure is rarely representative of the process by which composites are fabricated. Properties such as packing density and anisotropies that seem to easily occur in nature are very difficult to obtain with manual arrangements. This paper addresses the creation of complex 3D mixtures, comprising crystals embedded in a matrix, for subsequent electromagnetic (EM) analysis. The physically realistic arrangement of the crystals is facilitated by the use of physics engine software, specifically the Bullet physics library, which renders the realistic effects in advanced computer games. A composite mixture of crystals is created by pouring a series of random crystals into a box with the crystals bouncing against each other and aligning just as they do in the real world. Higher packing densities are obtained than can be reasonably obtained with manual construction. The arrangement of the obtained crystals reflects the real world alignment of asymmetric crystals. A composite is created here and used with EM simulation software to investigate energy localization in materials.},

However, exploiting such knowledge and converting it into actionable items is far from trivial, due to the vastness of the information available online as well as to its unstructured nature. In this research, we aim at (partially) crowdsourcing the software design, implementation and maintenance process by exploiting the knowledge embedded in various sources available on the Web (e.g., Stack Overflow discussions, presentations on SlideShare, open source code, etc.). For example, we want to support software design decisions (e.g., whether to use a specific library for the implementation of a feature) by performing opinion mining on the vast amount of information available on the Web, and we want to recommend refactoring operations by learning from the code written in open source systems. The final goal is to improve developers' productivity and code quality.},
