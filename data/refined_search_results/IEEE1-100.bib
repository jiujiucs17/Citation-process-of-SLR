abstract={Construction of interval models of static and dynamic systems based on methods of analysis of interval data leads to the formation of common structural elements, based on the specifics of their use for specific subject areas. The use of common structural elements in their software implementation inevitably leads to duplication and redundancy of program code.This problem can be solved by creating a single software package for computer simulation of static and dynamic systems implemented on the algorithms of the bee colony with guaranteed accuracy.This article focuses on the implementation of software architects, which includes requirements analysis, implementation of use cases, as well as information software. The article also describes the specifics of the implementation of service-oriented software architecture, as one of the options for using the developed database of model experiments for use in various subject areas.},

pages={127-132},
abstract={Network software is typically organized according to a layered architecture that is well understood. However, writing correct and efficient code that conforms with the architecture still remains a problem. To overcome this problem we propose to use a domain specific language based approach. The architectural constraints are captured in a domain specific notation that can be used as a source for automatic program generation. Conformance with the architecture is thus assured by construction. Knowledge from the domain allows us to generate efficient code. In addition, this approach enforces reuse of both code and designs, one of the major concerns in software architecture. In this paper, we illustrate our approach with PADDLE, a tool that generates packet processing code from packet descriptions. To describe packets we use a domain specific language of dependent types that includes packet overlays. From the description we generate C libraries for packet processing that are easy to integrate with other parts of the code. We include an evaluation of our tool.},

abstract={The traditional approach to develop user interface for handset devices has limited flexibility on the UI requirement changes. Once the UI requirement changed, programmers have to change their handcrafted application once again. This change may occur repeatedly until the UI requirement under consideration is satisfied. Visual-based software construction methodology has been developed. This methodology helps programmers to develop the user interface for handset devices, and allows programmers to migrate their program to new platform quickly. Based on this methodology, we quest for a generic software framework to incorporate the proposed methodology for developing user interface to alleviate the problems mentioned above. From our study, there are some similarities exist among user interface and software framework in different handset devices. In this paper, we propose a generic software framework for the system architecture design of handset devices. Specifically, the software framework generated based on the generic software framework is much easier for maintenance and management compared with the traditional approach. In addition, the software framework that is instantiated from the generic software framework can be incorporated into the visual requirement authoring system for user interface development. Finally, we design and construct a simulator to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the software framework generated by the proposed generic software framework.},

abstract={Design in packaged software implementation (PSI) is the process to solve business problems by customizing and integrating the off-the-shelf software package.

The success of CBD depends on a continuous cycle of knowledge creation. This paper presents a theoretical framework of case-based design as an organizational knowledge creation process. Based on this framework, the research proposes an innovative tool to support CBD in packaged software implementations. The fundamental belief is that by utilizing the collective power of a large group of people, better designs can be achieved at lower costs},

abstract={Several notations and techniques have been proposed to capture and represent software architecture decisions and structures. Previous work has suggested that using automated techniques to recover decisions and structures from whichever project artifacts are actually kept may be a reasonable solution, but empirical evaluations of this claim are scarce. This article describes: (1) the TREx design decision and architecture structure recovery technique and tool, (2) precision and recall measures of recovery effectiveness for system structure, and (3) an experimental design to evaluate design decision and structure recovery approaches. An initial experimental evaluation of manual versus tool-supported TREx shows that using the tool increases recall, but yield mixed results on precision: decrease structure recovery precision, but increase decision recovery. Also anecdotic evidence suggest that only Experts were systematically better in recovering decisions without tool-support. A replicable experimental package has been published.},

abstract={Exploring an unfamiliar large-scale software system is challenging, especially when based solely on source code. While software visualizations help in gaining an overview of a system, they generally neglect architecture knowledge in their representations, e.g., by arranging elements along package structures rather than functional components or locking users in a specific abstraction only slightly above the source code. In this paper, we introduce an automated approach for software architecture recovery and use its results in an immersive 3D virtual reality software visualization to aid accessing and relating architecture knowledge. We further provide a semantic zoom that allows a user to access and relate information both horizontally on the same abstraction level, e.g., by following method calls, and vertically across different abstraction levels, e.g., from a class to its containing component. We evaluate our contribution in a controlled experiment contrasting the usefulness regarding software exploration and comprehension of our concepts with those of the established CityVR visualization and the Eclipse IDE.},

pages={212467-212477},
abstract={Understanding software architecture is essential to software maintenance. There has been much effort to derive software architecture views from source code artifacts. Typically, along with structural information, the semantic information derived from an identifier name and comments are helpful. However, because code vocabulary choice depends on a developer's subjective decision, some source code may have semantically low text quality, leading to an inaccurate architecture recovery. This paper aims to improve the architecture recovery of a software system by identifying and removing the semantic outliers of source code artifacts. Accordingly, we propose a novel measure Conceptual Conformity (CC), which computes the similarity between two latent topic distributions obtained from both the source code and its package. We use CC to identify source code that is not relevant to the package's semantic context and define it as a semantic outlier. Because the semantic outliers may cause inaccurate architecture recovery, we remove them during the recovery process. We apply our approach to three open-source projects. The results demonstrate that, for projects with low recovery performance, removing outliers leads to higher recovery accuracy.},

abstract={The microservices architecture is a relatively new approach in implementing service-oriented systems. This cloud-native architectural style enables the implementation of loosely coupled, agile, reuse-oriented, and lightweight services instead of monoliths. It also eliminates vendor and/or technology lock-ins. A modification to a small code segment for monoliths may require the building and deployment of a completely new version of the software. However, the modular form of microservices allows solving software versioning in a polyglot manner. In this paper, we extend the well-known microservice design pattern API gateway with a view to managing the virtual hardware configuration of containers. Specifically, using the proposed approach, the service capacity in the requested version of the service is orchestrated adaptively in compliance with a service-level agreement. In our tests, we found that the proposed version management approach reduced the hosting cost by 27% compared to static or rule-based scaling.},

abstract={Recovering the architecture is the first step towards reengineering a software system. Many reverse engineering tools use top-down exploration as a way of providing a visual and interactive process for architecture recovery. During the exploration process, the user navigates through various views on the system by choosing from several exploration operations. Although some sequences of these operations lead to views which, from the architectural point of view, are mode relevant than others, current tools do not provide a way of predicting which exploration paths are worth taking and which are not. In this article, we propose a set of package patterns which are used for augmenting the exploration process with information about the worthiness of the various exploration paths. The patterns are defined based on the internal package structure and on the relationships between the package and the other packages in the system. To validate our approach, we verify the relevance of the proposed patterns for real-world systems by analyzing their frequency of occurrence in six open-source software projects},

There is a significant latency gap between internal and external memory accesses. The external memory access might downgrade the performance of embedded systems.

In this paper, we propose a software cache API to help programmers to ease this problem. The proposed API includes pointwise element access and block version of access to software cache. We also give a detailed description for design and implementation of software cache API. As a case study, the software cache API is implemented on PAC DSP, a high performance DSP aiming for multi-media applications. We evaluate the implementation with UTDSP benchmark suite. The experiment results show that the proposed software cache can efficiently reduce the external memory access times.},

abstract={Requirements engineering approaches are appropriate when software is to be developed from scratch. However, in most organization, new software is now created by integrating functionality from existing software and components or by implementing packaged software. In such cases, it makes little sense to specify requirements in terms of what the software should do - the functionality is already defined in this software. Rather, we argue that it is more appropriate to consider the software requirements from a misalignments perspective - what functions software provides and who needs that functions to do their job and what misalignments between software functions and users' needs. To explore this area, we study cases of PS implementation in two software development companies. Our research design follows an interpretive approach, in which analysis was undertaken using an inductive approach. From an analysis of the cases, we induced a theoretical model explaining the requirement engineering practices (REP) for packaged software implementation.},

The difference between the contributions of the surfaces of individual engine parts to the overall level of its sound power for the investigated variants of the oil pan design is shown. Analysis of the results of calculating the structure-borne noise of diesel in nominal mode showed that the change in the design of the oil pan led to a redistribution of the frequency composition of the sound power spectrum: the amplitudes of harmonics in the high frequency range increased, and the overall level increased by 2 dBA.},

abstract={The report describes a flexible software package for modeling the production planning process to solve the problem of optimizing the preparation of calendar schedules of multiassortment continuous-discrete enterprises characterized by a large range of products, many types and configurations of equipment. Since the number of variants of production schedules increases exponentially with increasing dimensionality of the task, it is relevant to develop a specialized complex of effective optimal planning, insisting on the characteristics of various multi-assortment productions. The development is based on the use of methods of the theory of schedules, optimization and evolutionary calculations, tools for object-oriented development of complex software systems and databases. The proposed software package has various intelligent user interfaces supplemented by databases of products, equipment and technological regulations, a library of objective functions and mathematical optimization methods, a module for expert system configuration, as well as an interactive visualization system of the obtained production plans in the form of a Gantt chart and a tree of optimization problem solutions. Testing of the software package on real industrial data of polymer and metallurgical industries confirmed the effectiveness of solving planning problems using the proposed methods and algorithms.

abstract={It is always a hot issue in the research process of software project to focus on specific field, construct software architecture, find efficient technology of software development, and improve the efficiency and reuse of software development [1,2]. On the basis of software design in the field of industry control, this paper puts forward a design method based on the flow, resource and data. The concepts of flow and resource are defined based on the construction of the software’s basic architecture. Problems and process of the solutions are expressed as flow; hardware and code used in the flow are shown as resource; data in different levels may have different explanations and structures, because data image realizes the coupling of flow and heterogeneous data in the resource. Because the dependence of software design, designers’ knowledge in specific field and computer ability is reduced, the software characters of versatility and reuse are enhanced.},

abstract={The major cause of lightning disaster is the Lightning Electromagnetic Pulse (LEMP). Disaster risk assessment services have been widely used in lightning protection centers of many cities in China for years. At present, electromagnetic environment assessment services are being used more and more at many lightning protection centers in China, with various methods. Most of them adopt an expensive commercial software package which needs 3D modeling of complex structure and high computational costs. This article describes a useful assessment tool based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method focusing on an electromagnetic environment of buildings featured with a simple setup procedure. This software package has been applied in daily evaluation services, filling gaps of the current commercial software, leading to a great potential in this area.},

abstract={Context: Software architecture (SA) as research area experienced an increase in empirical research, as identified by Galster and Weyns in 2016 [1]. Empirical research builds a sound foundation for the validity and comparability of the research. A current overview on the evaluation and replicability of SA research objects could help to discuss our empirical standards as a community. However, no such current overview exists.Objective: We aim at assessing the current state of practice of evaluating SA research objects and replication artifact provision in full technical conference papers from 2017 to 2021.Method: We first create a categorization of papers regarding their evaluation and provision of replication artifacts. In a systematic literature review (SLR) with 153 papers we then investigate how SA research objects are evaluated and how artifacts are made available.Results: We found that technical experiments (28%) and case studies (29%) are the most frequently used evaluation methods over all research objects. Functional suitability (46% of evaluated properties) and performance (29%) are the most evaluated properties. 17 papers (11%) provide replication packages and 97 papers (63%) explicitly state threats to validity. 17% of papers reference guidelines for evaluations and 14% of papers reference guidelines for threats to validity.Conclusions: Our results indicate that the generalizability and repeatability of evaluations could be improved to enhance the maturity of the field; although, there are valid reasons for contributions to not publish their data. We derive from our findings a set of four proposals for improving the state of practice in evaluating software architecture research objects. Researchers can use our results to find recommendations on relevant properties to evaluate and evaluation methods to use and to identify reusable evaluation artifacts to compare their novel ideas with other research. Reviewers can use our results to compare the evaluation and replicability of submissions with the state of the practice.},

year={2014},

pages={285-290},
abstract={This paper presents both the general model and a case study of the Computational and Collaborative Philology Library (CoPhiLib), an ongoing initiative underway at the Institute for Computational Linguistics (ILC) of the National Research Council (CNR), Pisa, Italy. The library, designed and organized as a reusable, abstract and open-source software component, aims at solving the needs of multi-lingual and cross-lingual analysis by exposing common Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The core modules, coded by the Java programming language, constitute the groundwork of a Web platform designed to deal with textual scholarly needs. The Web application, implemented according to the Java Enterprise specifications, focuses on multi-layered analysis for the study of literary documents and related multimedia sources. This ambitious challenge seeks to obtain the management of textual resources, on the one hand by abstracting from current language, on the other hand by decoupling from the specific requirements of single projects. This goal is achieved thanks to methodologies declared by the “agile process”, and by putting into effect suitable use case modeling, design patterns, and component-based architectures. The reusability and flexibility of the system have been tested on an Arabic case study: the system allows users to choose the morphological engine (such as AraMorph or Al-Khalil), along with linguistic granularity (i.e. with or without declension). Finally, the application enables the construction of annotated resources for further statistical engines (training set).},

abstract={The description of the system for the searching similar program solutions for software project or module was proposed in this paper. The search is performed under the project architecture in order to abstract from the implementation. The UML meta-scheme is used to represent the project architecture. Design templates are used as generally accepted software design solutions. To perform a search among projects, it is necessary to store UML diagrams with their semantics, ontologies in OWL format are suitable for this. Search can be carried out among projects from public repositories and organizations internal repositories. The initial data for the search are the class diagram of the developing project and the names of the public libraries structural elements. The paper describes the structure and description of ontology on the basis of which the system was build. The rules, nuances and examples of the transformation of the architectural solution into ontology are given. An example of the proposed approach to the problem of finding architectural solutions for integration with the public service API is considered. The paper contains an analysis of the results and directions for further research.},

abstract={Multicore hardware is ubiquitous, but billions of lines of code in performance-critical commodity software are still sequential. Although parallel libraries, design patterns, and best practice guidelines are available, thinking parallel is still a big challenge for many software engineers. In this paper we present a case study on parallelizing commodity software using a commercial real-time audio application with over 700,000 lines of code. In contrast to best practice guidelines, our goal is to investigate what parallelization strategy can effectively be used in data stream-intensive applications. Performing an in-depth analysis of the software architecture and its run-time performance, we locate parallelization potential and propose three different parallelization strategies. We evaluate them with respect to their parallel performance impact. Regarding the application's intrinsic real-time requirement and a very short audio cycle turnaround time, a busy-waiting strategy offers the best audio performance of 327 μs per cycle on an eight-core machine. With an efficiency of 99% this is close to the optimal schedule.},

title={Automated program transformation for migration to new libraries},
year={2011},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-7},
abstract={In modern software engineering the task of migration from one system environment to another may arise very often (e.g. software migrating from Windows to Linux or from desktop PC to some mobile platform). This task may be accomplished manually, but this will certainly be not cost- and time-effective and will require additional testing and verification. Therefore various automated techniques aimed to solve this problem seem to be very useful. The article takes into consideration one of such approaches, mainly focused on transferring source code between two library environments. A comprehensive review of related works is presented. The classification of typical library entities having strong impact to software characteristics is defined. Special program annotation language (PanLang) is introduced. The main purpose of this language is to specify library structure and behavior. The key feature of PanLang is the high level of abstraction allowing to take out of consideration the library implementation details. Therefore, PanLang annotation applied to a library is a partial specification. Such a specification may be considered as a Moore FSM. The problem of semantic conformance of source and target libraries' specifications is posed. The conformance is guaranteed if set of execution traces corresponding to source library may be represented as a subset of target's one. In our case the solution of this problem may be reduced to FSM homomorphism detection. Our approach considers using Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) as a model of source code. Therefore after semantic conformance is proved, special transformation rules may be applied ASG. These rules are based on both source and target partial specifications which guarantee correctness of result software. A simple prototype migration tool based on proposed approach is described. This Java-based tool uses CLang frontend to LLVM for C source code parsing and ASG construction. A number of sample migration tasks were used to prove the method correctness and efficiency. Possible improvements and future researches are also discussed.},

abstract={Re documentation and design recovery are two important areas of reverse engineering. Detection of recurring organizations of classes and communicating objects, called software patterns, supports this process. Many approaches to detect software patterns which have been published in the past years suffer from the problems of necessity of reference library, performance and language compatibility. This paper presents a model to solve those problems in software pattern detection. The proposed model solves the problem of necessity of reference library by detecting software patterns using formal concept analysis (FCA). The proposed model solves the problem of performance by using the most efficient algorithm CMCG (Concept-Matrix Based Concepts Generation) for the construction of concept lattice, which is the core data structure of FCA. The proposed model solves the problem of language compatibility by using the language independent meta model called MOOSE for taking the input information. The validity of this model was proved in theory and by experiment.},

abstract={Software developers often include available open-source software packages into their projects to minimize redundant effort. However, adding a package to a project can also introduce risks, which can propagate through multiple levels of dependencies. Currently, not much is known about the structure of open-source package ecosystems of popular programming languages and the extent to which transitive bug propagation is possible. This paper analyzes the dependency network structure and evolution of the JavaScript, Ruby, and Rust ecosystems. The reported results reveal significant differences across language ecosystems. The results indicate that the number of transitive dependencies for JavaScript has grown 60% over the last year, suggesting that developers should look more carefully into their dependencies to understand what exactly is included. The study also reveals that vulnerability to a removal of the most popular package is increasing, yet most other packages have a decreasing impact on vulnerability. The findings of this study can inform the development of dependency management tools.},

abstract={Software products developed with the clone-and-own approach pose difficulties in maintenance. Migrating to software product line can solve this problem. This paper proposes an approach to recover software product line architecture (PLA) from a family of products developed with the clone-and-own approach. The proposed approach decomposes all source code of the family of products and analyses cloned copy classes, cloned modification classes and product-specific classes. From the results, it recovers a PLA. For determining common and variable classes, the proposed approach uses Harmonized Total Constant Commonality Indices of packages or classes of a product line (HTCCIPL).

abstract={The paper covers the area of block-structured adaptive grid generation for finite difference, finite element and finite volume methods. It deals with a problem of development of information technologies and algorithms for generating such grids in complex geometries. Its key idea is to bring together the different existing techniques for computer-aided geometric design of domains, grid generation, grid concentration and grid subdivision. The methods used for a construction of domain geometries, working with block-structured quasi-continuous grids, a subdivision of block-structured adaptive grids into vertex-centered control volumes, generation of ghost nodes and cells, calculation of distances to boundaries are discussed. It is described of the software interfaces of the geometry editor and the mesh generator that were developed in the SIGMA preprocessor. The results of the generation of three-dimensional adaptive grids for the domain of external flow near a hemisphere, flow around a surface of the high-speed aircraft of Falcon HTV-2 type and for the domain of the gap between a wheel and a body of an aircraft are analyzed. The presented methods and algorithms for grid generation have the following advantages: 1. The grids are structured and mesh cells are hexahedra in the entire complex curvilinear computational domain. 2. The grids can be applied for finite difference methods. 3. The grid lines are adjusting with the flow in the whole domain.},

The particle accelerator is controlled by RF control system, built as a chain of RF stations bound to cryomodules across the tunnel. Each RF station has a set of additional devices, that are used to control particular parts of the system. The core library for device module handling was designed using Distributed Objected Oriented Control System (DOOCS) framework as a base, and then it was extended by implementing component software pattern design, thus allowing simplified and universal way of handling communication with the hardware, as well as handling other tasks such as data validation and application logic. The library is implemented by using modern C++11/14 standards and utilizing Boost library features where necessary. The server applications utilize the library to provide common device access by using Chimera Tool Kit, as well as other register-based protocols like Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). In addition to the core library, two device-specific libraries were created to provide the flexibility of embedding them into third party DOOCS server applications if needed.},

abstract={Code reuse has long been a holy grail of Information Technology. When realized, it is manifested either by sharing source code or by sharing binary code. The free software and open source movements promote the sharing of source code. The proprietary world promotes market mechanisms through exclusive rights of ownership to binary code, protected by licenses and copy protection mechanisms. When binary code is shared by many owners in the proprietary world, it is packaged as either software libraries or software frameworks, abstractions in which common binary code providing generic functionality can be leveraged, extended, and specialized. With software libraries, owners write code that calls library code; with software frameworks, owners write callback code that is called by framework code. This paper details benefits and drawbacks of these two types of shared binary code abstractions and suggests best practices, from a practical perspective and concerning large and complex implementations of software frameworks in sizable enterprises.},

abstract={Application-level software dependability is difficult to ensure. Thus it's typically used only in custom systems and is achieved using one-of-a-kind, handcrafted solutions. We are interested in understanding whether and how these techniques can be applied to more common, lower-end systems. To this end, we have adapted a condition-based maintenance (CBM) approach called the multivariate state estimation technique (MSET). This approach automatically creates sophisticated statistical models that predict system failure well before failures occur, leading to simpler and more successful recoveries. We have packaged this approach in the Software Dependability Framework (SDF). The SDF consists of instrumentation and data management libraries, a CBM module, performance visualization tools, and a software architecture that supports system designers. Finally, we evaluated our framework on a simple video game application. Our results suggest that we can cheaply and reliably predict impending runtime failures and respond to them in time to improve the system's dependability},

abstract={Genome annotations are often published as plain text files describing genomic features and their subcomponents by an implicit annotation graph. In this paper, we present the GenomeTools, a convenient and efficient software library and associated software tools for developing bioinformatics software intended to create, process or convert annotation graphs. The GenomeTools strictly follow the annotation graph approach, offering a unified graph-based representation. This gives the developer intuitive and immediate access to genomic features and tools for their manipulation. To process large annotation sets with low memory overhead, we have designed and implemented an efficient pull-based approach for sequential processing of annotations. This allows to handle even the largest annotation sets, such as a complete catalogue of human variations. Our object-oriented C-based software library enables a developer to conveniently implement their own functionality on annotation graphs and to integrate it into larger workflows, simultaneously accessing compressed sequence data if required. The careful C implementation of the GenomeTools does not only ensure a light-weight memory footprint while allowing full sequential as well as random access to the annotation graph, but also facilitates the creation of bindings to a variety of script programming languages (like Python and Ruby) sharing the same interface.},

abstract={The static structure is the physical organization of a system's functional modules in terms of their structural relations. It is the packaging of the dynamic structure into textually self-contained modules, taking into consideration the construction strategy and how much of module's internal part should be visible to other modules. Hierarchical modular diagrams (HMD), a module-interface-oriented graphics language that develops can specify the structural relations among modules and map design concepts into a hierarchy of program components independently of the implementation language, is described. The application of HMD to manage a real-time system in a library of separately compiled Ada units is described. It is shown that by using HMD in conjunction with modern software engineering languages like Ada, the static structure can be built earlier in the design process. This lets designers evaluate safety-critical issues as well as reusability concerns long before they make safety checks and implementation decisions. More important, engineers can analyze the effect of approaches to incremental construction before committing additional resources.<>},

abstract={Multiple-valued logic (MVL) is used in various fields of knowledge such as logic, philosophy, logic circuits design, reliability engineering or artificial intelligence. MVL is generalization of well-known binary logic and unlike binary logic MVL allows operating with a larger number of truth degrees and provides numerous tools for problem formalizing and solving. In order to describe relationships between inputs and the result of certain phenomena in the MVL a mapping of n multi-valued inputs into m-valued output called MVL-function is needed. The MVL-function can be used for example in electrical engineering, computer engineering, logic or reliability engineering. MVL-function is a fundamental element of MVL. Therefore a software library for working with MVL and MVL-functions is needed for implementation of numerous applied problems. The software implementation of demanding process such as symbolic calculations with MVL-functions is hard. New software library for working with MVL and logic functions is introduced in this paper. This software library is programmed in C++ for fast and efficient performance. It can be used for helping student with symbolic calculations of MVL-function or as a support library for complex programs, which need to work with logic function.},

For the design of pavements, one of the most used methodologies in Latin America is the proposal for AASHTO in 1993. Figures, tables, and equations are used in this methodology, which could confuse an inexperienced designer. Therefore, several computer programs have been developed using this methodology, however, they only show the results and not the process to get to these ones. In this context, this study aims to develop software for designing flexible pavements, rigid pavements and overlayer on the flexible pavement, which allows users to observe the procedure carried out by the program. Those individuals programs make up the computational package called UTPLPave, which is a free online version and it was developed using JavaScript libraries in HTML5 and BootStrap. This program can be used as a complementary tool for university education or for updating of knowledge of pavement designers.},

abstract={Computational Intelligence (CI) algorithms/techniques are packaged in a variety of disparate frameworks/applications that all vary with respect to specific supported functionality and implementation decisions that drastically change performance. Developers looking to employ different CI techniques are faced with a series of trade-offs in selecting the appropriate library/framework. These include resource consumption, features, portability, interface complexity, ease of parallelization, etc. Considerations such as language compatibility and familiarity with a particular library make the choice of libraries even more difficult. The paper introduces MeetCI, an open source software framework for computational intelligence software design automation that facilitates the application design decisions and their software implementation process. MeetCI abstracts away specific framework details of CI techniques designed within a variety of libraries. This allows CI users to benefit from a variety of current frameworks without investigating the nuances of each library/framework. Using an XML file, developed in accordance with the specifications, the user can design a CI application generically, and utilize various CI software without having to redesign their entire technology stack. Switching between libraries in MeetCI is trivial and accessing the right library to satisfy a user's goals can be done easily and effectively. The paper discusses the framework's use in design of various applications. The design process is illustrated with four different examples from expert systems and machine learning domains, including the development of an expert system for security evaluation, two classification problems and a prediction problem with recurrent neural networks.},

In order to improve the efficiency and quality of management information system (MIS), the reusable component technology has been introduced in MIS. Through the description of the structure and features, the reusable components are used in the structure and features of MIS in the development process such as demands analysis, system design, system implementation, system testing, and system maintenance. The result shows that supporting and implementing the assembly of MIS under the platform of component running has improved the stability quality and development efficiency of the existing MIS.},

abstract={Shorter design cycles in FPGA-based Programmable System-on-Chips (PSoCs) development require a higher level of design automation, which has led to a wide acceptance of model driven engineering. However, design and implementation of applications on such heterogeneous PSoC platforms still demand a comprehensive expertise in hardware/software co-design. Therefore, to keep up with this trend, an automated systematic design flow that couples model-based design and simulation with High-Level Synthesis (HLS) for hybrid hardware and software implementations is necessary. In order to address this issue, the work at hand makes use of the modeling and simulation environment MATLAB/Simulink, a de facto standard in model-based development. Additionally, we present a novel design flow which automatically synthesizes individual hardware/software solutions for Xilinx Zynq PSoCs based on a manual partitioning of blocks. Thereby, the proposed methodology enables control and system engineers to automatically explore different hardware and software implementation variants from a behavioral model. As a case study, we present a JPEG decoder application and investigate design objectives like resource costs and throughput to show the practicability of our approach.},

While the existing approaches to modeling software systems often neglect the issue of COTS component-mismatch detection and elimination. Aiming at solving this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive software architecture model. Based on this model, we first analyze and conclude the mismatches among heterogeneous components, and then we propose the corresponding solutions to eliminate these mismatches and provide a seamless integration for COTS components.

abstract={To afford the dramatic intra- and inter-datacenter traffic growth envisioned for the decade, the IEEE P802.3bs Task Force is targeting the standardization of 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s Ethernet. Transceivers adopting this standard will need to substantially reduce cost and power consumption with respect to similar equipment that are currently the state-of-the-art for long-haul networks. The most promising solution for such a challenging objective is offered by integrated photonics, a state-of-the-art technology capable of providing high-speed components and large-scale circuits with high-volume, high-yield, and low-cost manufacturing.Synopsys proposes an integrated software (SW) environment capable of assisting with virtual prototyping and testing of the circuit before proceeding with the physical implementation. It is the integration of the OptSim Circuit tool for schematic-driven photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design, with the PhoeniX OptoDesigner photonic layout tool, and the RSoft Photonic Component Design Suite, thus providing a single modeling solution at the circuit, layout, and device levels of abstraction. In this work, we first present this integrated SW environment, focusing on its potential and usability. Then, we use the APSUNY Silicon Photonics Integrated Circuit Process Design Kit (PDK) library sponsored by AIM Photonics to model a PM-16QAM transceiver with a 400G transmission data rate.},

title={Header-driven generation of sanity API tests for shared libraries},
year={2010},
volume={},
number={},
pages={97-102},
abstract={There are thousands of various software libraries being developed in the modern world - completely new libraries emerge as well as new versions of existing ones regularly appear. Unfortunately, developers of many libraries focus on developing functionality of the library itself but neglect ensuring high quality and backward compatibility of application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by their libraries. The best practice to address these aspects is having an automated regression test suite that can be regularly (e.g., nightly) run against the current development version of the library. Such a test suite would ensure early detection of any regressions in the quality or compatibility of the library. But developing a good test suite can cost significant amount of efforts, which becomes an inhibiting factor for library developers when deciding QA policy. That is why many libraries do not have a test suite at all. This paper discusses an approach for low cost automatic generation of basic tests for shared libraries based on the information automatically extracted from the library header files and additional information about semantics of some library data types. Such tests can call APIs of target libraries with some correct parameters and can detect typical problems like crashes “out-of-the-box”. Using this method significantly lowers the barrier for developing an initial version of library tests, which can be then gradually improved with a more powerful test development framework as resources appear. The method is based on analyzing API signatures and type definitions obtained from the library header files and creating parameter initialization sequences through comparison of target function parameter types with other functions' return values or out-parameters (usually, it is necessary to call some function to get a correct parameter value for another function and the initialization sequence of the necessary function calls can be quite long). The paper also describes the structure of a tool that implements the proposed method for automatic generation of basic tests for Linux shared libraries (for C and C++ languages). Results of practical usage of the tool are also presented.},

abstract={An industrial experience of the use of a method for discovering customer requirements with which to configure an off-the-shelf software package for implementation is reported. The method uses an adapted form of product variability model to provide common ground between the customer and supplier about requirements and capabilities. An associated decision support software tool guides the supplier and customer through a model-based walkthrough to discover new requirements, based on equivalent capabilities described in the product variability model. We applied the method in the work processes of the commercial provider of a software-based learning management system, and collected quantitative and qualitative data from supplier-customer interactions. Our first experiences with the method led to an increased exposure and expression of customer requirements in the customer-supplier dialogue, compared to the baseline dialogue during software package demonstrations. The paper also reports some first lessons learned to improve the method and adopt its use with other software supplier organizations.},

pages={229-234},
abstract={Requirements engineering approaches are appropriate when software is to be developed from scratch. However, in most organization, new software is now created by integrating functionality from existing software and components or by implementing packaged software. In such cases, it makes little sense to specify requirements in terms of what the software should do - the functionality is already defined in this software. Rather, we argue that it is more appropriate to consider the software requirements from a misalignments perspective - what functions software provides and who needs that functions to do their job and what misalignments between software functions and users' needs. To explore this area, we study cases of packaged software (PS) implementation in two software development companies. Our research design follows an interpretive approach, in which analysis was undertaken using an inductive approach. From an analysis of the cases, we induced a theoretical model explaining the requirement engineering practices (REP) for PS implementation.},

In particular, various concrete cooling simulation methods were compared and the cooling pipe discrete element method using in this software was introduced in detail. Details on the development process, software modules, and functions of major modules were introduced in this paper.

year={2009},

pages={830-836},
abstract={Much of modern software development consists of assembling together existing software components and writing the glue code that integrates them into a unified application. The term COTS-based system (CBS) is often used to describe such applications, for which the components assembled are understood to be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components written by a multitude of independent third parties. The manner of assembly in CBS includes full-source components that are integrated at compile-time, pure-binary libraries incorporated at load-time, and plugins that are loaded into the application at execution time by the user.Because components have access to system resources, applications may crash due to faulty components or may be compromised by malicious components. In this paper, we ask the question: can hardware support the development and deployment of CBS by providing applications with a trusted platform for managing components and their interactions?We present an architecture that places each CBS component in a hardware-enforced container. The hardware then detects improper usage of system resources (unauthorized memory accesses or denial-of-service) and enables applications to undertake a hardware-supervised recovery procedure. Furthermore, the hardware also maintains a violation record to enable developers to recreate the violation for the purpose of debugging and further development. Taken together, the purpose of the architecture we propose is to enable executing untrusted CBS code on trusted hardware.},

abstract={In recent years, although there has been a significant decline in construction occupational disasters, construction and labor safety planning are still the focus of the government's vigorous promotion. According to the data from the Institute of Labor and Occupational Safety and Health of the Ministry of Labor, the construction industry has the highest occupational accident rate per thousand people, indicating that construction occupational safety still needs to be greatly improved. BIM has been widely used in construction projects. Its visibility, coordination, and simulation characteristics should be able to find construction hazards that are relatively invisible on general 2D construction drawings. Thus, this study uses BIM to assist in analyzing the construction risks of the bridge and researches on construction activities of relatively high risks with a bridge project as an example, to reduce the risks that may occur during actual construction activities. The research results indicate that the weight of each part of the main bridge tower is obtained by the BIM model, and the crane is selected after the rated load is calculated. This process prevents the weight of hanging objects from exceeding the rated load of the crane, thereby reducing the possibility of objects flying off from the crane. Two software packages, namely SketchUp and Fuzor, are used to simulate the movement line of the crane and the gyration radius of a hanging operation in advance. This process reduces (1) the risk of collision between cranes due to an overlap of their gyration radii and (2) the risk of collision between the crane and construction personnel who enter into the gyration radius during hanging operations.},

volume={30},

pages={110-118},
abstract={With the present trend of multifunction and minimizing of size, the conventional electronic package type no longer meets the requirement of the new-generation products. Consequently, new type packaging, based on the wafer level packages (WLPs) and chip scale packages (CSPs) technology are being developed to achieve these requirements, as well as long term reliability. Novel wafer-level chip scale packages (WLCSP) with a stress buffer layer and bubble-like plate (Fig. 1) are proposed in this research to improve the solder joint fatigue life. The thermal stress caused by the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch can be significantly reduced, and the reliability of the WLP could be substantially enhanced by this new design. In order to realize the relationship of the solder joint fatigue life, stress buffer layer and bubble-like plate, a finite element parametric analysis applying software ANSYS is utilized. In additions, the methodology based on the finite element method (FEM) used in the study has been verified by the relative experiments in our previous researches. The design parameters include the thickness of the stress buffer layer, thickness, bending angle and standoff height of the different types of bubble-like plate. The results of the FEM analysis reveal that the stress buffer layer and bubble-like plate can relax the thermal stresses of solder joints and enhance the package reliability. Besides, the peeling stress between stress buffer layer and two different types of bubble-like plates is discussed, and the stress state of the leadframe is also analyzed in this research. Furthermore, the findings of this research can be used as the guideline for advanced WLCSP design},

abstract={Architectures for software use rich abstractions and idioms to describe system components, the nature of interactions among the components, and the patterns that guide the composition of components into systems. These abstractions are higher level than the elements usually supported by programming languages and tools. They capture packaging and interaction issues as well as computational functionality. Well-established (if informal) patterns guide the architectural design of systems. We sketch a model for defining architectures and present an implementation of the basic level of that model. Our purpose is to support the abstractions used in practice by software designers. The implementation provides a testbed for experiments with a variety of system construction mechanisms. It distinguishes among different types of components and different ways these components can interact. It supports abstract interactions such as data flow and scheduling on the same footing as simple procedure call. It can express and check appropriate compatibility restrictions and configuration constraints. It accepts existing code as components, incurring no runtime overhead after initialization. It allows easy incorporation of specifications and associated analysis tools developed elsewhere. The implementation provides a base for extending the notation and validating the model.<>},

The variants of the new dialog boxes created with the Tekla Open API are shown, which illustrate the possibilities of this approach to correct information models of bridges created in the Tekla program.},

abstract={The report authors have developed a LANDSLIP software package for visual modeling and landslide slopes stress-strain state calculation in JAVA programming language. It has various modifications (flat and spatial versions, various calculation models etc.). The user interacts with the LANDSLIP by means of visual modeling on the Graphics User Interface. The user does not interact with all other LANDSLIP objects, they are completely controlled by the Graphics User Interface. It creates all other objects, modifies, uses, and, if necessary, removes them. The interaction between the user and the Graphics User Interface is performed via the menu system. Using the graphical editor menu, the user can create objects to describe the landslide structure and manipulate the additional sliding surfaces, groundwater lines set and program functions responsible for mathematical calculations and design documentation preparation. The LANDSLIP software package is equipped with interfaces that facilitate collecting data from the MicroStation environment, digital map, and geological database. The geological cross-sections are automatically created, and geotechnical soil parameters are evaluated. The software enables the stability analysis of any slopes or scarps using various calculation methods. It ensures wide opportunities to predict, evaluate and combat natural threats. The LANDSLIP software package results reliability was verified by comparative calculations via similar Canadian SLOPE/W software package at the design office of the “Turów” brown coal mine in Poland. The results differences are within the acceptable limits and depend on the peculiarities of initial-boundary conditions input in various graphic editors, various calculation models, etc.},

year={2020},

pages={31-39},
abstract={For high-performance computing (HPC) system designers and users, meeting the myriad challenges of next-generation exascale supercomputing systems requires rethinking their approach to application and system software design. Among these challenges, providing resiliency and stability to the scientific applications in the presence of high fault rates requires new approaches to software architecture and design. As HPC systems become increasingly complex, they require intricate solutions for detection and mitigation for various modes of faults and errors that occur in these large-scale systems, as well as solutions for failure recovery. These resiliency solutions often interact with and affect other system properties, including application scalability, power and energy efficiency. Therefore, resilience solutions for HPC systems must be thoughtfully engineered and deployed. In previous work, we developed the concept of resilience design patterns, which consist of templated solutions based on well-established techniques for detection, mitigation and recovery. In this paper, we use these patterns as the foundation to propose new approaches to designing runtime systems for HPC systems. The instantiation of these patterns within a runtime system enables flexible and adaptable end-to-end resiliency solutions for HPC environments. The paper describes the architecture of the runtime system, named Plexus, and the strategies for dynamically composing and adapting pattern instances under runtime control. This runtime-based approach enables actively balancing the cost-benefit trade-off between performance overhead and protection coverage of the resilience solutions. Based on a prototype implementation of PLEXUS, we demonstrate the resiliency and performance gains achieved by the pattern-based runtime system for a parallel linear solver application.},

pages={779-783},
abstract={This paper presents the design of a system for testing database-centric software applications using surrogate databases. Traditional testing approaches, such as using test bed databases and using stub code or mock objects, are often either difficult to implement and manage, or do not provide entirely effective verification of the functionality of the application under test. Testing database-centric applications using database surrogates addresses these issues. A database surrogate is a data source, such as an XML file, which has the same structure as the backend database of the application under test. Database surrogates can be easier to implement and manage than actual test bed databases, but provide a mechanism for thoroughly testing the functionality of the application under test. The essence of the surrogate database testing system is to create a very lightweight library which provides an interface which is independent of the actual physical implementation of the underlying data source.},

pages={20-29},
abstract={We suggest to model software package flaws (bugs) by assuming eventual Byzantine behavior of the package. In particular, the package has been tested by the manufacturer for limited length scenarios when started in a predefined initial state; the behavior beyond the tested scenario may be Byzantine. Restarts (reboots) are useful for recovering such systems. We suggest a general yet practical framework and paradigm, based on a theoretical foundation, for the monitoring and restarting of systems. An autonomic recoverer that monitors and restarts the system is proposed, where: the autonomic recoverer is designed to handle different tasks given specific task requirements in the form of predicates and actions. DAG subsystem hierarchy structure is used by a consistency monitoring procedure in order to achieve gracious recovery. The existence and correct functionality of the autonomic recovery is guaranteed by the use of a kernel resident (anchor) process, and the design of the process to be self-stabilizing. The autonomic recoverer uses new scheme for liveness assurance via online monitoring that complements known schemes for online ensuring safety.},

year={2017},
volume={53},
number={6},
pages={2950-2962},
abstract={Based on currently developed on-board platforms, this paper proposes a software architecture for orbiting spacecraft for autonomously establishing formation, station-keeping, and reconfiguring maneuvers. Components of the software architecture include orbital prediction (OP), orbital control (OC), and relative navigation (RN); these not only meet the constraining requirements of attitude control, thermal control, thrusters, and the ground-based operator, but also have a minimal impact on the on-board data handling (OBDH) system. All of the OP, OC, and RN algorithms are packaged as a subroutine (OPCNS) called by the OBDH system at regular intervals. The in-advance control instruction set (CIS) is temporarily stored in random access memory to be read by OPCNS as a formal argument, rather than in any fixed space of read only memory. The simplified general perturbations 4 method is introduced to perform a specific time interval of OP based on filtered relative measurements of RN. The relative-orbital-element (ROE) control method is employed to create in-advance instructions, depending on whether or not the predicted ROEs trigger the threshold values of any maneuver and then to allocate these instructions into the CIS following the proposed relationship rules between all of the ROEs and the ground control instruction. To tolerate the temporary divergence of the RN filter after any orbital maneuver, an ROE-based unscented Kalman filter is enhanced by using the control instruction in current execution to accelerate the co- nvergence. A 3-craft formation scenario for interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements is used to validate all of the functions of the proposed software architecture.},

abstract={Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT), including spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) and swept-source OCT (SS-OCT), allows the volumetric imaging of the tissue architecture with a faster speed and higher detection sensitivity than does time-domain OCT. Although the hardware implementations of SD-OCT and SS-OCT are different, these technologies share very similar signal processing steps for image reconstruction. In this study, we developed hardware implementations and software architectures to design a generic framework for FD-OCT. For SD-OCT systems, an external synchronization approach was used to realize a data acquisition schematic similar to that used in SS-OCT by carefully managing the timing clocks in the detection unit and for the waveform generation. In addition, by utilizing modules and factory concepts, a software engine can be developed that supports various acquisition devices and software operations or image processing functions with high operation flexibility while maintaining its robustness. Data processing and data saving were optimized using the parallel computing method with the OpenMP library and by leveraging the parallelism within the acquired data, respectively.},

Previously, we had some difficulties in developing applications using our platform APIs. Their name was ambiguous, and their functions were not primitive, and even their documentation was not enough to refer to. Therefore, we had to maintain our platform APIs. In this paper, we propose an API design process and API evaluation guidelines. "API Analysts" elicit functions from requirement documents. "API designer" design APIs for the functions following the guidelines. "Technical writers" produce documentation for the APIs. "API reviewers" evaluate the APIs and API documentation conforming to the proposed guidelines. Proposed process made our platform APIs more convenient to use for developing applications.},

abstract={Since observing every aspect of external software behavior is almost impossible, it is crucial to designate an adequate range for quality evaluation such as an adequate number of quality checklists or product quality metrics. In this paper, a repository accumulating the quality checklists and metrics having dependency relationships with external characteristics of software is suggested. The repository is created and maintained with the prior sample data of software defects or evaluation records. In the repository, multiple external characteristics of software are mapped as nodes to affect and determine the priority ranks of quality checklists. The advantage of the repository is the easy extension of inference mechanism. When the feedback is sent back from the quality certifier and stakeholders, the inference mechanism is extended to reflect the new sample data without separate training upon its own structure of nodes network.},

abstract={Flexible roofs become an integral part of modern building constructions. Being widely used for public buildings, they have great potential in the field of industrial construction as well. Flexible roofs, however, possess complex structural behavior. They require deep understanding of the key concepts by designers and project managers, who implement them into a real life. Civil engineering and architectural specializations need to incorporate flexible constructions into the academic activity. It will ensure competitiveness of prospective specialists in the job market. Active learning approach is considered for mastering flexible roof structures. Prototyping is an essential tool for long-term memorization of the key concepts. Modern computer technologies and specialized software packages, however, gradually displace laboratory modeling. Structural deformability, geometrically nonlinear behavior, preliminary stressing and equilibrium structural shape can be easily grasped by means of computer simulation and numerical investigation of exemplary constructions.},

abstract={Sustainability and environmental matters are two important discussion topics at present. Some other important issues, e.g. the use of energy, are related to sustainability matters. In order for a country to develop and grow economically, energy is a significant element that is mostly used in buildings and the problem is that they waste the energy especially in public buildings such as libraries. As a result, analyzing and retrofitting energy consumption in public buildings is the purpose of the present research. It will be done by applying Building Information Modeling (BIM) software with the aim of reaching comfort level and energy management. BIM software was applied in a case study and with the help of the energy analysis software then the analysis was carried out. Improving the efficiency of energy consumption was made possible, through identifying and changing the present patterns of energy usage. With the aim of changing the materials, internal design and the building's comfort level, a practical method was suggested in this case study which resulted in a safe temperature for books, a comfortable temperature for users, in addition to energy preservation of up to 25%.},

abstract={The paper presents a practical approach to construction of a software tool, which will be suitable for deployment of Java components in distributed and heterogeneous testbeds. Requirements of such a system are identified, and a suitable architecture, which is scalable and allows the installation and starting Java applications on chosen computational nodes, is proposed. The modular architecture of the constructed system is based on JMX (Java management extensions), which require packaging each Java component as an MBean and providing a deployment descriptor for it in the form of an XML MLet file. Such an approach can be applied to building a lightweight framework for Java applications and services using only one Java virtual machine per computational node, where each component is installed and started in the same JVM, thus limiting valuable resource consumption. This approach cannot be useful for end-user applications without additional services allowing it to control and manage the deployed modules. Some of them include standard JMX services, such as the MLet service (for dynamic loading), while some have to be developed specifically for the purpose of operating in distributed testbeds. A detailed discussion of the system requirements, architecture of the implemented system called JIMS, built on the top of JMX core components are presented in this paper.},
