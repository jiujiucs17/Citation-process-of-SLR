abstract={This paper presents a methodology for a unified co-simulation and co-synthesis of hardware-software systems. This approach addresses the modeling of communication between the hardware and software modules at different abstraction levels and for different design tools. The main contribution is the use of a multi-view library concept in order to hide specific hardware/software implementation details and communication schemes. A system is viewed as a set of communicating hardware (VHDL) and software (C) sub-systems. The same C, VHDL descriptions can be used for both co-simulation and hardware-software co-synthesis. This approach is illustrated by an example.<>},

abstract={In automated production systems, an increasing proportion of functionality is implemented by control software. However, currently most companies do not implement variant and version management for their control software and, thus, lack a global knowledge base on existing software variants and versions. Further, despite its known drawbacks, i.e., low maintainability, the reuse strategy copy, paste & modify is commonly applied, leading to an even higher amount of unmanaged, historically grown software variants and versions. Since the resulting control software contains a vast amount of essential domain knowledge, strategies for its planned reuse are required. Therefore, this paper presents a workflow to enable the transfer from copy, paste & modify to planned reuse by analyzing the historically grown control software variants and deriving reusable library modules from them. For the library module development from multiple sources, an interaction concept is proposed, which has been evaluated partially through a prototypical implementation.},

year={2022},

pages={164-169},
abstract={In recent years, various vendors have made quantum software frameworks available. Yet with vendor-specific frameworks, code portability seems at risk, especially in a field where hardware and software libraries have not yet reached a consolidated state, and even foundational aspects of the technologies are still in flux. Accordingly, the development of vendor-independent quantum programming languages and frameworks is often suggested. This follows the established architectural pattern of introducing additional levels of abstraction into software stacks, thereby piling on layers of abstraction. Yet software architecture also provides seemingly less abstract alternatives, namely to focus on hardware-specific formulations of problems that peel off unnecessary layers. In this article, we quantitatively and experimentally explore these strategic alternatives, and compare popular quantum frameworks from the software implementation perspective. We find that for several specific, yet generalisable problems, the mathematical formulation of the problem to be solved is not just sufficiently abstract and serves as precise description, but is likewise concrete enough to allow for deriving framework-specific implementations with little effort. Additionally, we argue, based on analysing dozens of existing quantum codes, that porting between frameworks is actually low-effort, since the quantum- and framework-specific portions are very manageable in terms of size, commonly in the order of mere hundreds of lines of code. Given the current state-of-the-art in quantum programming practice, this leads us to argue in favour of peeling off unnecessary abstraction levels.},

abstract={Knowledge graph has been more and more widely used, but software knowledge graph is still in the initial stage. To explore the way of constructing a software knowledge graph, this paper proposes a case study by using source code, related documents and relations among the information to build software knowledge graph. The source code comes from the open source project Tomcat, the related documents come from various software communities. Different approaches are designed for each type of resources to achieve entity and attribute extraction, and to categorize the relation into internal and external relations to extract. Internal relation is contained in each resource, external relation exists between different resources. And then subtree comparison and mailbox matching are used to align entities, completing the construction of software knowledge graph. Software knowledge graph is applied to knowledge retrieval and association visualization to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition.},

abstract={Spatial transforms formalize mappings between coordinates of objects in biomedical images. Transforms typically are the outcome of image registration methodologies, which estimate the alignment between two images. Image registration is a prominent task present in nearly all standard image processing and analysis pipelines. The proliferation of software implementations of image registration methodologies has resulted in a spread of data structures and file formats used to preserve and communicate transforms. This segregation of formats hinders the compatibility between tools and endangers the reproducibility of results. We propose a software tool capable of converting between formats and resampling images to apply transforms generated by the most popular neuroimaging packages and libraries (AFNI, FSL, FreeSurfer, ITK, and SPM). The proposed software is subject to continuous integration tests to check the compatibility with each supported tool after every change to the code base (https://github.com/poldracklab/nitransforms). Compatibility between software tools and imaging formats is a necessary bridge to ensure the reproducibility of results and enable the optimization and evaluation of current image processing and analysis workflows.},

abstract={A lab assignment for CS2 students, first time in a team environment, to design and implement a task-list manager with advanced graphical user interface in two one-hour labs has been well received. Students had studied list and binary search tree implementations and Java I/O but with minimal knowledge of graphical user interface. A student acted as the system architect providing Unified Modeling Language diagrams for design. The Task-List Manager consists of a split-pane on the left side containing a tree (for task-list creation and selection), the right side containing another splitpane with a table (containing the tasks in the selected task-list) in the top side, and a text pane in the bottom for detailed notes of the selected task. Students were required to look up the Java documentation for appropriate classes. The tree may contain folders with nested folders and task-lists with layout adjustable with drag-and-drop. A right click on any folder or task-list produces a popup menu with editing options. Based on student feedback, the success stems from creating a practical product and learning through independently investigating the Java documentation for data structure and graphical user interface classes and hands-on software development in a team environment.},

title={MDD: A Unified Model-Driven Design Framework for Embedded Control Software},
year={2022},
volume={41},
number={10},
pages={3252-3265},
abstract={Model-driven methods are widely used in embedded control software development. Current design tools, such as Ptolemy-II and Simulink, have strong modeling capability but their simulation and code generation functionalities are challenged by the increasing complexity of control requirements. For simulation, emulating the triggering of the actor leads to additional time overhead and speed degradation. For code generation, generating redundant content degrades the code quality. Besides, current tools do not have a unified interface, which makes it difficult to cooperation. In this article, we propose a unified model-driven design framework MDD to facilitate embedded control software development. MDD can support the unification of models built by different modeling tools for high-efficiency simulation and high-quality code generation. The MDD framework supports the expansion of more modeling tools, and also supports the expansion of more uses, such as unified testing and verification. First, it offers a model intermediate representation (MIR) and several corresponding parsers, which facilitate a unified representation and cooperation for different design tools. Then, based on data flow schedule analysis of the original MIR, intermediate code representation will be generated for optimized code synthesis. Finally, a variety of code translators will synthesize the intermediate code representation into the code of actual use, such as code for simulation and code for deployment. For evaluation, we enhance two widely used design tools in industry, Ptolemy-II and Simulink, and apply them on the implementation of several benchmark models and a real-world self-driving control software of our industrial collaborator. Using MDD can help reduce their simulation time by 98.9% and 92.6%, the generated code by 99.7% and 69.9% in the number of lines, and 94.3% and 34.3% in code execution time, respectively.},

abstract={As a fact, the application of object-oriented approach is of high significance in the area of software development since it can abet efficiency or cost effectiveness and reduce error probability during software design and implementation. In order to quantify, especially qualitative aspects such as potential error hot spots caused by elevated design complexity, software measurement can strongly assist. Particularly, metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer as well as Abreu's MOOD metrics set are presumably most prevalent in practice and provide adequate explanatory power. Especially the object-oriented programming language Java cannot be dismissed from one's thoughts because a lot of Java libraries serve as foundation for contemporary applications. Thus, after initially defining language bindings for the aforementioned metrics, we perform measurement and evaluation of various Java standard libraries like J2SE, J2EE, J2ME, JWSDP and few others concerning different aspects. The results acquired are beneficial to be used by software designers for aligning and orienting their design with common industry practices. Furthermore, our extensive measurements enable us to carry out key metrics correlation studies incorporating many thousand Java classes},

abstract={BIM is a highly collaborative process that is change construction industry operation globally, with capacity to increase efficiencies, improved performance, and enhancing productivities by increasing collaboration among AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) professionals and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. In view of the importance of teaching BIM concepts to architecture students, some schools of architecture in Greater Khartoum recognized the importance of teaching BIM for fulfilling educational requirements of the industry, but they are faces many challenges. The research proposes an Approach to introduce BIM into architectural curriculum in schools of architecture in Greater Khartoum, the Approach were created by the criteria that must be considered when planning a BIM course, also the preferred concepts and methodologies for introduce BIM into architecture curriculum, which assists in planning courses with BIM content. The research discusses the current global BIM education and establishing of BIM curriculum. Interview method was adopted for this research for the in-depth information, and the Content Analysis process was used to analyze the curriculums of some schools of architecture in Greater Khartoum that adopt BIM, to examine the current concepts and methodologies into introducing BIM and compared it to the proposed approach, also identify challenges in the implementation of BIM process and teaching. Findings reveal that the introducing of BIM into architecture curriculum in Greater Khartoum is still in a very primitive phase, there are Two universities and one college out of fifty schools of architecture in Greater Khartoum introduced BIM in their curricula, and they faces many of critical barriers such as, the lack of BIM awareness, Lack of skilled faculty staff to teach BIM, lack of BIM standards, internet weakness, cost and resistance to change such as: high cost of original software, cost of computers of special specifications. The information presented in this research serves as a guide to introduce BIM education, and also give faculty time to taking great skill of required BIM learning. The research suggests partnerships between universities and construction industry firms.},

Epics was designed to fulfill these requirements and developed a prototype. Epics can be used by software vendors, ERP consulting firms, and ERP users. Human aspects play a critical role in ERP implementation. ERP implementation quality depends largely on how the implementation personnel's knowledge and past experiences are reused and communicated.

The algorithm components are of great importance to the performance of SDR, and need to be carefully designed. In this paper, first the principles of algorithm components design are introduced. After that, an example of algorithm component design is presented using a self-developed integrated development platform with a high-performance mathematical operation library, VSIPL, to realize target detection. A verification of validity and versatility is also given in the end of this paper. More algorithm components of radar signal and data processing can be developed and applied to actual application scenarios using this method.},

abstract={A Software Product Line (SPL) is a portfolio of products that targets a particular domain. Feature Models are generally used for modeling domain knowledge including variability within SPLs. The Product Line Architecture (PLA) defines the structure that all potential products in the SPL share. Designing a good PLA is challenging since different products may require different characteristics, and it is difficult to achieve an acceptable trade-off. In this paper we apply Model-Driven Engineering techniques for systematizing the Domain Engineering stage to enable the automation of the Application Engineering stage. We use features to modularize architectural decisions and we encode them as model transformations that render the fragment of the product architecture that addresses the features. Then, we make the rationale explicit, and we enhance evolvability and incrementality diminishing design complexity. Product implementation is derived by means of generators analogously. We show our approach by developing a Meshing Tool SPL.},

abstract={This paper describes the software and the software structure used in a family of high-capacity digital telephone switches. The call processing task is complex, and has great diversity. It must support existing and future features, including some not yet envisioned. The software must also provide man-machine interfaces, maintain the office database, and offer automatic recovery from hardware and software errors. It must also meet critical real-time performance specifications. The techniques adopted to meet these requirements include the use of a strongly typed high-level language, independent design and compilation of software modules, and the provision of an automated program library system and problem reporting system. Considerable experience in the development and support of large software systems has been accumulated, and is described in the paper.},

An approach has been proposed to the development of the software of an intelligent measurement system, which is based on the adoption of a concurrent, OO programming model named RTO - real time objects, which is described. RTO integrates in a natural way the OO development of the graphical user-interface.

The Bachelor of Science (Information Systems Management) degree program offered at SIS has been designed to contextualise the study of information systems and business management and to acquire practical competencies and skills though learning by doing in real world business settings. Thus, exposing students to complex enterprise level software systems has become a very essential component of the SIS education. However, the preparation of courses based on such software requires a non-trivial amount of background work. Using the Enterprise Web Solutions course and Microsoft Share Point 2010 as an example, this contribution analyses the challenges which arise due to the complexity of the infrastructure requirements, it also describes the difficulties involved in preparing the laboratory exercises and elaborating the project requirements. Finally, several suggestions are offered for those who are designing undergraduate level information systems courses involving enterprise level software packages.},

abstract={The purpose of this research is to enhance the structure of the 204-pin small outline dual in-line memory module (SODIMM) against the drop impact. According to the JEDEC regulations, the enhancement of PCB clips should be attempted to increase the resistance against drop impact. From high speed camera observation, the SODIMM module is pushed away from the PCB clips during drop impact. Therefore, the board pushing experiment was performed to measure the resistant force against PCB clips. Thereafter, two stages of finite element analysis (FEA) were executed to improve the resistance force of PCB clips. In the first stage, the finite element model of the SODIMM module was built to calculate the total resistance force against the constraint of PCB clips using FEA software ANSYS®. The simulation results were validated well with the board pushing experiment. The total resistance force is about 5.39 N in the original design. The second stage of the analysis is to proceed with the structural enhancement of PCB clips. Several parametric studies including discussions on the angle between clip and PCB, the length of the PCB clip, and the material properties of clip, were performed to improve the strength of clips. After the structural optimization, the total resistant force against the constraint of clip increased from 5.39 N to 8 N.},

The second element of good software design is cohesion, which is the strength or logical unity of a module. The highest (and most preferred) level is functional cohesion: a module with functional cohesion performs only one task.

abstract={Reconfigurable system-on-chip (RSoC) is a promising alternative to deliver both flexibility and performance at the same time, and also a technical solution looking to the future needs of embedded applications. But the complex design process is impeding the development of extensive applications. This paper proposes an RSoC design methodology based on function-level programming model on account of the characteristics of the reconfigurable architecture. In the programming model, system designers use high-level language to complete functional specification by calling the co-function-library. Then the dynamic hardware/software partitioning algorithm will decide whether an invoked function should be running on hardware or software automatically. According to the partitioning result, the dynamic linker will switch functions' execution mode in real time. And the above items can facilitate an automatic design flow through specification to the system implementation. Experiments and tests have verified the feasibility and efficiency of the automatic design flow.},

Although there are many studies on containerized applications in software deployment, there are few researches on related comprehensive solutions in other aspects of software lifecycle management in enterprises, such as code management, operation and maintenance, and third-party system integration. This paper takes company's business deployment architecture as the research object, and designs a comprehensive system construction plan. In this paper we describe the overall plan, and separately design the service deployment platform subsystem, system operation and maintenance subsystem, code management subsystem, and third-party integration subsystem. At the software level, we describe the business architecture and explain how the application software provides external services. Meanwhile, in order to verify the actual situation of the system deployment, a test module was designed to verify the actual system deployment. This comprehensive solution can satisfy the enterprise's integrated management of the software life cycle.},

abstract={Service Economics has been successfully proposed and implemented for promoting the macro service market especially in Global value chains which however does not provide guidance and integrate directly with the IT side implementation. Therefore there leaves a gap of the refinement from the strategic business planning to ubiquitous services implementation in the API (Application Program Interface) economy. Recently Gio Wiederhold attributed this gap to the knowledge difference between economists and the IT professionals and proposed to solve it from the IT side. As an instance of this guidance in the practice of Value Driven Design, we proposed a systemic formalization from the value calculation to the design quality measurement which binds the modification and change on the design artifacts with the business value strategy through a framework of managed quality properties in a service design process.},

abstract={Research in code and architectural analysis has demonstrated that a clear understanding of structural dependencies among software elements helps developers comprehend the impact of change. Yet examples are abundant from industry of major issues due to missed dependencies associated with different views of the architecture. Key concerns include dependencies related to allocation of modules to implementation packages to improve safety-critical testing and allocation of implementation packages to hardware partitions to optimize performance. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of a safety-critical system that underwent major changes as a result of missed architectural dependencies. We describe the challenges that resulted in re-architecting the system, the techniques we used for intervention, our results, and the developers' perspective. While the engineering tools provided coverage of design concerns, they missed implications of end-to-end integration testing, latency, and cost of change. In our study, we observed that the tools led the engineers to focus on data and control flow and therefore to miss many data-entity relationships, resource behavior, and deployment-related dependencies. Research continues to focus on more tooling and automation to assist with dependency analysis rather than interim, easier-to-adopt solutions. Our findings demonstrate that providing developers with a lightweight, semantically well-defined description of dependencies enables them to reason about change impact and propagation implications that they might otherwise overlook.},

abstract={Good software design quality is needed to reduce the number of errors in the implementation and testing phase. The SOLID design principles have been used as an object-oriented design guideline to meet software quality factors, such as understandability, flexibility, maintainability, and testability. In this paper we propose a set of metric to measure the conformity of class diagram to SOLID principles. In this study, we have analyzed the relationship between the concepts of SOLID principles with class diagram metrics, the metrics for each principles and the measurement techniques for class diagrams are produced. The proposed metrics for SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP are respectively VSRP (Value of SRP), VOCP (Value of OCP), VLSP (Value of LSP), VISP (Value of ISP) and VDIP (Value of DIP). The metric has been validated using 15 class diagrams extracted from seven software applications. A spearman's rank correlation has been used and it has described the correlation between the metrics. This suggests that the proposed metrics have demonstrated their practicality.},

pages={269-276},
abstract={Software Radio its a revolutionary paradigm in communications design, allowing the development of hardware stages, like communication physical layers, as simple software stages reducing costs and times of new wireless communication implementations. A project who works with software radio is GNU Radio, where many digital signal processes are implemented in C++ and Python language programming. This article describes a procedure to add the IT++ library into GNU Radio open source project, to be accessed as out-of-tree modules; this way allowing GNU Radio to exploit functions performed by other open-source projects. This SDR (Software Defined Radio) project works with many programmable cards like those from Ettus Research called USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral). The main goal is to expand the GNU Radio functionality with other open source projects (in Python or C++ language programming) to cover different wireless PHY layer processes.},

It provides a good software support for the expansion of GL Studio software in the field of developing virtual simulation interface. Based on the idea of designing virtual instrumentation control and the thought of establishing database, under the aviation instrument national military standard, the paper designed and realized a set of aviation instrument three-dimensional control library. Through the establishment of the control library which is similar with database, can ensure the independence integrity and consistency of the control, and it is helpful to maintain and recovery. This instrument control library has series of advantages like can be invoked easily, can be indexed, can be shared, can be maintained, safe reliable and so on. It has already been used and is proved to have good real-time and versatility.},

volume={},

pages={243-247},
abstract={Application specific design frameworks, such as GNU Radio for software defined radio, facilitate fast design flows by leveraging the common application structures of particular domains and rich libraries of elements tailored to them. However, due to their focus on the application, implementations derived from these frameworks are often unable to take advantage of target platform features to achieve high performance. To apply more extensive optimizations, applications described in such frameworks can be refined to formal models, making them more amenable to analysis and optimization. In this work, we present a method for integrating GNU Radio with a dataflow design framework, the Dataflow Interchange Format (DIF). We describe a translation from GNU Radio applications into a formal dataflow model and the software infrastructure we have used to integrate the two software packages. This integration allows GNU Radio to employ a variety of dataflow schedulers to improve performance on existing applications. Furthermore, by applying formal models to the application and the target architecture, this integration should allow for target specific optimizations for additional performance and target flexibility.},

pages={73-77 vol.1},
abstract={A modular architecture for communication systems is an attractive alternative to the well-known layering philosophy: instead of having a strict hierarchy of protocol layers, a modular communication system encompasses a collection of generic protocol functions which can be configured in an application-dependent way. The assumed benefits are simplification by removing redundant functionality and increased performance by composing only those functions that are required for the requested service. This paper presents performance measurements taken from the transport and internetworking package (TIP), which is a communication system based on a modular and object-oriented architecture. In particular, our measurements show the performance impact of modularization and configuration, and provide a rough estimate of how modular communication systems (i.e. TIP) perform as compared with monolithic communication systems (i.e. TCP/IP). In addition, we evaluate whether a modular software design reduces the costs for protocol implementation.},

pages={100-1003},
abstract={The recognition of big animals on the images with road scenes has received little attention in modern research. There are very few specialized data sets for this task. Popular open data sets contain many images of big animals, but the most part of them is not correspond to road scenes that is necessary for on-board vision systems of unmanned vehicles. The paper describes the preparation of such a specialized data set based on Google Open Images and COCO datasets. The resulting data set contains about 20000 images of big animals of 10 classes: "Bear", "Fox", "Dog", "Horse", "Goat", "Sheep", "Cow", "Zebra", "Elephant", "Giraffe". Deep learning approaches to detect these objects are researched in the paper. Authors trained and tested modern neural network architectures YOLOv3, RetinaNet R-50-FPN, Faster R-CNN R-50-FPN, Cascade R-CNN R-50-FPN. To compare the approaches the mean average precision (mAP) was determined at IoU≥50%, also their speed was calculated for input tensor sizes 640x384x3. The highest quality metrics are demonstrated by architecture YOLOv3 as for ten classes (0.78 mAP) and one joint class (0.92 mAP) detection with speed more 35 fps on NVidia Tesla V-100 32GB video card. At the same hardware, the RetinaNet R-50-FPN architecture provided recognition speed of more than 44 fps and a 13% lower mAP. The software implementation was done using the Keras and PyTorch deep learning libraries and NVidia CUDA technology. The proposed data set and neural network approach to recognizing big animals on images have shown their effectiveness and can be used in the on-board vision systems of driverless cars or in driver assistant systems.},

Design courses pose challenges to both the faculty and the students, since a wide range of perspectives are demanded. The power of computer-assisted instruction is very useful in developing such courses. Electrical distribution system design requires both physical and technical understanding, that can be provided using geographic information system (GIS) and analysis software. Circuit routing presents shortest distance problems, while choice of conductors and voltage level needs to satisfy specified voltage profiles. Overall cost depends on all these factors. The design and implementation of software for teaching underground secondary distribution system design is achieved in this paper. The faculty can use the software to impart the nuances in designing the secondary distribution system. The student can fulfil a design assignment with greater practical satisfaction.},

abstract={Rethinking the design strategies in implementing RPC based distributed systems offers significant promise. An area where additional RPC functionality is desirable is in the support for the procedural parameter or callback procedure. RPC support for callback procedures is desirable both for smooth development of new distributed applications as well as for distributing the execution of existing sequential programs. The paper analyzes the general problem of supporting callback procedures. The analysis flushes out the design requirements for an RPC implementation to support callbacks and explores potential advantages of implementing general support for callback procedures.},

title={On the Multiple Implementation of Abstract Data Types Within a Computation},
year={1983},
volume={SE-9},
number={4},
pages={395-411},
abstract={A fundamental step in the software design process is the selection of a refinement (implementation) for a data abstraction. This step traditionally involves investigating the expected performance of a system under different refinements of an abstraction and then selecting a single alternative which minimizes some performance cost metric. In this paper we reformulate this design step to allow different refinements of the same data abstraction within a computation. This reformulation reflects the fact that the implementation appropriate for a data abstraction is dependent on the behavior exhibited by the objects of the abstraction. Since this behavior can vary among the objects of a computation, a single refinement is often inappropriate. Accordingly, three frameworks are presented for understanding and representing variations in the behavior of objects and, thus, the potential for multiple implementations. The three frameworks are based upon: 1) a static partitioning of objects into disjoint implementation classes; 2) static partitioning of classes into implementation regions; and 3) dynamic partitioning of classes into implementation regions. These frameworks and analytic tools useful in investigating expected performance under multiple implementations are described in detail.},

year={2018},
volume={},
number={},
pages={33-36},
abstract={Translating a program written in one programming language to another can be useful for software development tasks that need functionality implementations in different languages. Although past studies have considered this problem, they may be either specific to the language grammars, or specific to certain kinds of code elements (e.g., tokens, phrases, API uses). This paper proposes a new approach to automatically learn cross-language representations for various kinds of structural code elements that may be used for program translation. Our key idea is two folded: First, we normalize and enrich code token streams with additional structural and semantic information, and train cross-language vector representations for the tokens (a.k.a. shared embeddings based on word2vec, a neural-network-based technique for producing word embeddings; Second, hierarchically from bottom up, we construct shared embeddings for code elements of higher levels of granularity (e.g., expressions, statements, methods) from the embeddings for their constituents, and then build mappings among code elements across languages based on similarities among embeddings. Our preliminary evaluations on about 40,000 Java and C# source files from 9 software projects show that our approach can automatically learn shared embeddings for various code elements in different languages and identify their cross-language mappings with reasonable Mean Average Precision scores. When compared with an existing tool for mapping library API methods, our approach identifies many more mappings accurately. The mapping results and code can be accessed at https://github.com/bdqnghi/hierarchical-programming-language-mapping) We believe that our idea for learning cross-language vector representations with code structural information can be a useful step towards automated program translation.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel bubble-shift super junction (SJ) MOSFET structure is proposed, and its main static electrical parameters and reverse recovery characteristics are simulated by TCAD software tool. By designing the P-pillar ion implantation windows with a certain offset, the bubble-shift SJ-MOSFET contains a curved pillar region in the upper half of the P-pillar. In the reverse recovery test of the proposed bubble-shift SJ-MOSFET, the peak reverse recovery current (Irrm) is reduced from 16.04 A to 15.21 A, and the current drop rate (di/dt) is reduced from 1587 A/μs to 815 A/μs. Correspondingly, the proposed device achieves a better reverse recovery characteristic while sacrificing a small fraction of the drain-source breakdown voltage (BV) and drain-source special on-resistance (Ron,sp). Compared with the BV of 700 V and the Ron,sp of 9 mΩ·cm2 of the benchmark SJ-MOSFET. The proposed device has a BV of 650 V and a Ron,sp of 12.4 mΩ·cm2. Mechanistically, the non-uniform depletion of the curved P-pillar reduces the carrier extraction rate, thereby prolonging the reverse current drop time (tf) and increasing the softness factor (S) of the bubble-shift SJ-MOSFET.},

Such a programming environment, named ASSIST, is based on a combination of the concepts of structured parallel programming and component-based programming. Some activities within the projects are devoted to the definition, implementation and testing of a methodology for the integration of a parallel numerical library into ASSIST. The goal is providing a set of efficient, accurate and reliable tools that can be easily used as building blocks for high-performance scientific applications. We focus on the integration of existing and widely used MPI-based numerical library modules. To this aim, we propose a general approach to embed MPI computations into the ASSIST basic programming unit. This approach has been tested using the MPICH implementation of MPI for networks of workstations. Some modifications have been applied to the MPICH process startup procedure, in order to make it compliant with the ASSIST environment. Results of experiments concerning the integration of routines from a well-known FFT package are discussed.},

abstract={When designing cloud applications many decisions must be made like the selection of the right set of software components. Often, there are several third-party implementations on the market from which software architects have the choice between several solutions that are functionally very similar. Even though they are comparable in functionality, the solutions differ in their quality attributes, and in their software architecture. This diversity hinders automated decision support in model-driven engineering approaches, since current state-of-the-art approaches for automated quality estimation often rely on similar architectures to compare several solutions. In this paper, we address this problem by contributing with a metamodel that unifies the architecture of several functional similar solutions, and describes the different solutions' architectural degrees of freedom. Such a model can be used later to extend the process of reuse from reusing libraries to reusing the corresponding models of these libraries with the lasting benefit of automated decision support at design-time that supports decisions when deploying applications into the cloud.

abstract={We have developed a Matlab/spl trade/ based software package for bio-signal analysis. The software is based on modular design and can thus be easily adapted to fit on analysis of various kind of time variant or event-related bio-signals. Currently analysis programs for event-related potentials (ERP), heart-rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin responses (GSR) and quantitative EEG (qEEG) are implemented. A tool for time varying spectral analysis of bio-signals is currently under construction. By combining different analysis tools it is possible to build analyzing procedures based on the software not only for simple sense or attention related tasks but also e.g. for responses measured during complicated psychological tests.},

Our approach is based on a new recognition algorithm which works incrementally rather than trying to analyse a possibly large software system in one pass without any human intervention. The new algorithm exploits domain and context knowledge given by a reverse engineer and by a special underlying data structure, namely a special form of an annotated abstract syntax graph. A comparative and quantitative evaluation of applying the approach to the Java AWT and JGL libraries is also given.},

abstract={Encrypted data transmissions through mobile communication channels are potentially vulnerable to cryptographic attacks since malicious agents may steal confidential information by running algorithms that can break the security of the encrypted data. Secure transfer of data through the combination of encryption and decryption, known as cipher, is the general approach to solving this problem in mobile communications. Specifically, stream ciphers do not suffer from propagation errors compared to other ciphers, and they tend to have better software efficiency. This research focuses on the applications of mobile communications for which stream ciphers are the natural choice. The research addresses the security of both Global System Mobile Communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), the two most prominent standards. By strengthening such communication channels, conversations can be secured, data can be saved from interception, and cellular fraud can be prevented. We investigate many aspects of stream ciphers, particularly Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR)-based stream ciphers. We develop comprehensive software libraries written in a prominent computer-programming language, with effective design of software interfaces.},

abstract={In the context of the fifth generation of mobile technology (5G), multiple technologies will converge into a unified end-to-end system. For this purpose, software defined networking (SDN) is proposed, as the control paradigm will integrate all network segments and heterogeneous optical and wireless network technologies together with massive storage and computing infrastructures. The control orchestration protocol is presented as a unified transport application programming interface solution for joint cloud/network orchestration, allowing interworking of heterogeneous control planes to provide provisioning and recovery of quality of service (QoS)-aware end-to-end services. End-to-end QoS is guaranteed by provisioning and restoration schemes, which are proposed for optical circuit/packet switching restoration by means of signal monitoring and adaptive modulation and adaptive route control, respectively. The proposed solution is experimentally demonstrated in an international multi-partner test bed, which consists of a multi-domain transport network comprising optical circuit switching and optical packet switching domains controlled by SDN/OpenFlow and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control planes and a distributed cloud infrastructure. The results show the dynamic provisioning of IT and network resources and recovery capabilities of the architecture.},

BCS-MPI delays the inter-processor communication in order to schedule globally the communication pattern and it is designed on top of a minimal set of collective communication primitives. In this paper we describe a prototype implementation of BCS-MPI and its communication protocols. Several experimental results, executed on a set of scientific applications, show that BCS-MPI can compete with a production-level MPI implementation, but is much simpler to implement, debug and model.},

Incidents are recognized as service disruptions which can have a considerable impact on business capability of IT organizations, thus calling for the implementation of efficient incident management and service restoration processes.

We describe the software architecture of the PAWN (producer-archive workflow network) environment that enables scalable, reliable marshalling and organization of distributed data into such enterprise storage environments. PAWN was initially developed to capture the core elements required for long term preservation of digital objects as identified by researchers in the digital library and archiving communities. In this paper, we show how PAWN can be extended to enable multiple clients at a number of distributed sites to prepare, organize, and bulk transfer large scale data onto clusters of servers that securely verify the integrity of the data, register the metadata, and store the data into an enterprise storage environment. PAWN allows detailed description, auditing, and organization of the data, and hence allows for efficient management, access, and disaster recovery. The basic software components are based on open standards and Web technologies, and hence are platform independent.},

The proposed architecture of the technology platform provides a solution to the problems of control of the intelligent integrated energy systems expansion and operation. To this end, the software implementation of methods, algorithms, and models is done as a repository of software components that are suitable for re-use. Based on the proposed architecture, we have developed a software prototype of the technology platform. The software prototype was employed to study the operating conditions and the control over them during the integration of electricity and heating systems. The calculations performed suggest that it may be feasible to employ the platform with the proposed architecture for intelligent integrated energy system studies.},

abstract={Analog circuits and systems research and education can benefit from the flexibility provided by large-scale Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs). This paper presents the hardware and software infrastructure supporting the use of a family of floating-gate based FPAAs being developed at Georgia Tech. This infrastructure is compact and portable and provides the user with a comprehensive set of tools for custom analog circuit design and implementation. The infrastructure includes the FPAA IC, discrete ADC, DAC and amplifier ICs, a 32-Bit ARM based microcontroller for interfacing the FPAA with the user's computer, and Matlab and targeting software. The FPAA hardware communicates with Matlab over a USB connection. The USB connection also provides the hardware's power. The software tools include three major systems: a Matlab Simulink FPAA program, a SPICE to FPAA compiler called GRASPER, and a visualization tool called RAT. The hardware consists of two custom PCB designs which include a main board used to program and control an FPAA IC and an FPAA IC adaptor board used to interface a QFP packaged FPAA IC with the 100 pin ZIF socket on the main programming and control board.},

year={2013},
volume={1},
number={},
pages={731-734},
abstract={One of the greatest challenges to using Building Information Modelling (BIM) for the documentation of architectural heritage is in overcoming the propensity of the software toward standardization. Most BIM applications are optimized for industrialized building systems where even a minor deviation in geometry or dimension between like elements is considered problematic. Heritage buildings, on the other hand, are more typically constructed of unique elements that, while sometimes similar, can never be assumed to be identical. For example, two Corinthian capitals from the Temple of Mars Ultor may be similar, but they are not the same. In this paper, we discuss a novel method for developing a BIM for a unique vernacular building in eastern Ontario, Canada. Constructed anonymously in two discrete stages during the last half of the 19C, the builders employed both stacked log and an idiosyncratic balloon frame construction. Both types of construction are far from the standard assemblies found in commercial BIM software. In discussing the construction of the model, we will outline the integration of detailed survey data, including pointcloud, with a library of `typical', but parametric, construction details under development by our research group. While the survey provides an accurate geometrical record of the building under discussion - including structural deformations - the library is used to develop the specific assemblies and is based on, and fully indexed to, `typical' details culled from construction manuals available in Canada during the late 19C.},

title={EAGLE: Creating Equivalent Graphs to Test Deep Learning Libraries},
year={2022},
volume={},
number={},
pages={798-810},
abstract={Testing deep learning (DL) software is crucial and challenging. Recent approaches use differential testing to cross-check pairs of implementations of the same functionality across different libraries. Such approaches require two DL libraries implementing the same functionality, which is often unavailable. In addition, they rely on a high-level library, Keras, that implements missing functionality in all supported DL libraries, which is prohibitively expensive and thus no longer maintained. To address this issue, we propose EAGLE, a new technique that uses differential testing in a different dimension, by using equivalent graphs to test a single DL implementation (e.g., a single DL library). Equivalent graphs use different Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), data types, or optimizations to achieve the same functionality. The rationale is that two equivalent graphs executed on a single DL implementation should produce identical output given the same input. Specifically, we design 16 new DL equivalence rules and propose a technique, EAGLE, that (1) uses these equivalence rules to build concrete pairs of equivalent graphs and (2) cross-checks the output of these equivalent graphs to detect inconsistency bugs in a DL library. Our evaluation on two widely-used DL libraries, i.e., Tensor Flow and PyTorch, shows that EAGLE detects 25 bugs (18 in Tensor Flow and 7 in PyTorch), including 13 previously unknown bugs.},

abstract={Cooperative software engineering typically involves many actors and resources that cooperate in a complex distributed and heterogeneous world. In the DIPS (Distributed Integrated Process Services) project, a 3D model is used for the definition, enactment and tracing of software development processes, which expresses both the structure and evolution of such processes. This paper discusses how an optimal architecture was evaluated to implement the process model in a process support framework. Process-specific and general requirements are identified, and expected usage patterns of a DIPS-based environment are analyzed. A set of potential architecture variants is proposed, and implications of the requirements and usage patterns on the variants are discussed qualitatively. An evaluation of the architecture alternatives leads to the design of a hybrid DIPS architecture based on distributed heterogeneous objects. The prototype DIPS implementation is briefly outlined.},

We further discuss a new algorithm for real-data DFTs of prime size, a new way of implementing DFTs by means of machine-specific single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) instructions, and how a special-purpose compiler can derive optimized implementations of the discrete cosine and sine transforms automatically from a DFT algorithm.},

abstract={Exception-handling structures provide a means to recover from unexpected or undesired flows that occur during software execution, allowing the developer to put the program in a valid state. Still, the application of proper exception-handling strategies is at the bottom of priorities for a great number of developers. Studies have already discussed this subject pinpointing that, frequently, the implementation of exception-handling mechanisms is enforced by compilers. As a consequence, several anti-patterns about Exception-handling are already identified in literature. In this study, we have picked several releases from different Java programs and we investigated one of the most well-known anti-patterns: the empty catch handlers. We have analysed how the empty handlers evolved through several releases of a software product. We have observed some common approaches in terms of empty catches' evolution. For instance, often an empty catch is transformed into a empty catch with a comment. Moreover, for the majority of the programs, the percentage of empty handlers has decreased when comparing the first and last releases. Future work includes the automation of the analysis allowing the inclusion of data collected from other software artefacts: test suites and data from issue tracking systems.},

abstract={The current generation of emergency managers weather information network (EMWIN) and low-rate information transmission (LRIT) receivers are predominantly software based and require low retail cost. In the geostationary operational environmental satellite R-series (GOES-R) paradigm, the rates for EMWIN and LRIT will be increased significantly. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a low-cost software-based terminal, that can be used to receive GOES-R generation LRIT and EMWIN transmissions, as well as legacy EMWIN and LRIT signals. This work also describes the software architecture used to build the proposed software radio, which was designed using an advanced application programming interface (API) called GNU Radio and is designed to utilize multiple core processors on a desktop workstation. We discuss the hardware requirements needed to demodulate LRIT and EMWIN signals, and summarize key system capabilities and performance.},

abstract={Many modern software systems are implemented as client/server architectures, where a server handles multiple clients concurrently. Testing does not cover the outcomes of all possible thread and communication schedules reliably. Software model checking, on the other hand, covers all possible outcomes but is often limited to subsets of commonly used protocols and libraries. Earlier work in cache-based software model checking handles implementations using socket-based TCP/IP networking, with one thread per client connection using blocking input/output. Recently, servers using non-blocking, selector-based input/output have become prevalent. This paper describes our work extending the Java PathFinder extension net-iocache to such software, and the application of our tool to modern server software.},

abstract={The kernel objects consist of critical kernel data structures and system call functions, which are the most important data for a system, should be protected as first-class candidates. In this paper, a lightweight system-level detection and recovery infrastructure is presented for embedded systems. Inside the infrastructure, specific runtime protections have been implemented for different kernel objects, kernel data structures are protected by the periodic detection and recovery, the interception of arguments is used to protect vulnerable system calls. At runtime once any system inconsistency has been detected, predefined recovery actions will be invoked. The consistency detection regulations and corresponding recovery actions can also be flexibly customized by system developers. The infrastructure requires few modifications to kernel source code, thus it is easy to integrate into existing embedded systems. The evaluation experiment results indicate our prototype system can correctly detect the inconsistent kernel data structures caused by security attacks and also prevent kernel from exploits due to vulnerable system calls with acceptable penalty to system performance. Moreover, it is fully software-based without introducing any specific hardware and requires no modifications to system call APIs, therefore legacy commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications can be also easily reused.},
