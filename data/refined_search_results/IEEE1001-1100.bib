This paper presents how an application with micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors controlled by software can be modeled and simulated at high abstraction level. The overall modeling and simulation methodology lies on the extensions of SystemC named SystemC AMS/MDVP. In order to illustrate our approach, a case study is presented which integrate three-axis MEMS containing an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, and its associated CPU. A special focus is put on the MEMS gyroscope.},

abstract={The current Deep Learning (DL) landscape is fast-paced and is rife with non-uniform models, hardware/software (HW/SW) stacks. Currently, there is no DL benchmarking platform to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of DL innovations, be it models, frameworks, libraries, or hardware. As a result, the current practice of evaluating the benefits of proposed DL innovations is both arduous and error-prone - stifling the adoption of the innovations. In this work, we first identify 10 design features that are desirable within a DL benchmarking platform. These features include: performing the evaluation in a consistent, reproducible, and scalable manner, being framework and hardware agnostic, supporting real-world benchmarking workloads, providing in-depth model execution inspection across the HW/SW stack levels, etc. We then propose MLModelScope, a DL benchmarking platform that realizes these 10 design objectives. MLModelScope introduces a specification to define DL model evaluations and provides a runtime to provision the evaluation workflow using the user-specified HW/SW stack. MLModelScope defines abstractions for frameworks and supports the board range of DL models and evaluation scenarios. We implement MLModelScope as an open-source project with support for all major frameworks and hardware architectures. Through MLModelScope's evaluation and automated analysis workflows, we perform a case-study analysis of 37 models across 4 systems and show how model, hardware, and framework selection affects model accuracy and performance under different benchmarking scenarios. We further demonstrate how MLModelScope's tracing capability gives a holistic view of model execution and helps pinpoint bottlenecks.},

abstract={This article describes a methodology named Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR) based on Goals, Questions, and Metrics (GQM) principles. Indicators are defined based on metrics for a decision-making process. Its main contributions are the construction of an information process system model and a prototype, involving GQM approach, in a quantitative definition and qualitative metrics. The CAR methodology is a process area (PA) of the Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMi) for software development from Carnegie Mellon University. This PA was used to eliminate systematic error cases listed in a Technical Report (TR) generated by CAR. An information system model was created to allow the elimination of defects, errors, and failures in a design pattern named IO Manager, during the test phase, and before its publication in a components library. The prototype was created using Rational Rose RealTime (RRRT) with focus on verification tests. It provided a quality assessment to the IO Manager design pattern. The use of this methodology was based on GQM and CAR along with the information process system model. The developed prototype aimed to monitor errors on design pattern tests in real-time embedded system of a software production line.},

pages={276-280},
abstract={The article is devoted to the development of information technology for recognizing the destructive influences in the non-verbal content of the sound sequences of multimedia messages of Internet-oriented mass media. The necessity of determining the significant signs of informational and psychological influence in the tonality of the sound series is introduced. It was found that, first of all, such characteristics of music as pulsation, a binaural effect and changes in the main tone should be analyzed. It is proposed to determine the signs of information-psychological influence by analyzing the music used in multimedia messages, which destructive properties have been proven. The object of the study is the music of the song (`I want neither love nor honor'), which is used as a video background in the famous suicidal game (`Blue Whale'). To analyze the tonality of music on each quasi-stationary fragment, the time variation of the modulus, the real part, and also the imaginary part of the complex representation of the Fourier coefficient was calculated. During the calculations, the length of the quasi-stationary fragment was 1024 samples, which at a sampling rate of 44100 Hz corresponds to about 20 ms. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that significant signs of information and psychological influence are the low-frequency nature of the sound, the periodic nature of the amplitude-time indicators of the sound signal with a period of 5-12 seconds, the periodic nature of the amplitude-frequency indicators of the fundamental tone of the sound signal with a period of 5-7 seconds. To calculate and visualize these indicators, a software package specially developed in the MatLab 2018 environment was used. It is proposed to correlate the ways of further research with the development of a method for recognizing the presence of destructive influences in the non-verbal content of the sound sequences of multimedia messages distributed in Internet-oriented mass media.},

abstract={A large number of tools are already available to aid in the development of parallel scientific applications, yet many developers are unaware they exist, do not have access to them, or find them too difficult to use. And, unlike the wider software development community where the use of integrated development environments is best practice, parallel software development languishes with the lowest common denominator of command-line tools and Emacs style editors. By harnessing the power and flexibility of the phenomenally successful Eclipse framework, we have developed a platform for the integration of parallel tools that aims to provide a robust, portable, and scalable parallel development environment for the development of high performance scientific computing applications. The Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform utilizes a model-view-controller design and a generic API architecture to support a wide range of parallel computing environments. The platform has been designed so that it is easily extensible, and will support the integration of existing and new parallel tools. In this paper we describe the architecture of the platform, provide details of an example implementation for a particular parallel runtime system, and show how other parallel tools can be integrated with the Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform},

title={Does Infrastructure as Code Adhere to Semantic Versioning? An Analysis of Ansible Role Evolution},
year={2020},
volume={},
number={},
pages={238-248},
abstract={Ansible, a popular Infrastructure-as-Code platform, provides reusable collections of tasks called roles. Roles are often contributed by third parties, and like general-purpose libraries, they evolve. As such, new releases of roles need to be tagged with version numbers, for which Ansible recommends adhering to the semantic versioning format. However, roles significantly differ from general-purpose libraries, and it is not yet known what constitutes a breaking change or the addition of a feature to a role. Consequently, this can cause confusion for clients of a role and new role contributors. To alleviate this issue, we perform an empirical study on semantic versioning in Ansible roles to uncover the types of changes that trigger certain types of version bumps. We collect a dataset of over 70000 version increments spanning upwards of 7800 Ansible roles. Moreover, we design a novel structural model for these roles, and implement a domainspecific structural change extraction algorithm to calculate structural difference metrics. Afterwards, we quantitatively investigate the state of semantic versioning in Ansible roles and identify the most commonly changed components. Then, using the structural difference metrics, we train a Random Forest classifier to predict applicable version bumps for Ansible role releases. Lastly, we confirm our empirical findings with a developer survey. Our observations show that although most Ansible role developers follow the semantic versioning format, it appears that they do not always consistently follow the same rules when selecting the version bump to apply.},

abstract={Schedulability of distributed real-time system has been studied extensively. However, due to the discrepancies the reference model used in scheduling analysis and the object-oriented model, the results cannot be easily used for distributed real-time object-oriented software development. Even if object-oriented models can be used to conduct schedulability analysis successfully, there still lacks an effective approach to validate the implementation with the design. Model-based approach alleviates the discrepancies between models of different stages and the implementation by automatically transforming models at different granularity until the code generation for the implementation from the generated design. In this paper, an approach to incorporating schedulability analysis reference diagrams into the existing framework for model-based software development will be presented. It will improve the predictability of a distributed real-time system as well as increase the capability of model refinements and code generation using the new reference diagrams and schedulability analysis results to generate code for implementing scheduling and synchronization aspects of the distributed real-time system.},

abstract={In this paper, dynamic simulation methods for reliability evaluation of common industry-based control system architectures are investigated. Control system design often employs complex reliability structures in the forms of several levels of software and hardware redundancies, hot and cold standby systems. This is required in order to achieve certain plant availability and safety functions. Control system maintenance requires expert knowledge due to the complexity of troubleshooting steps involved with a hardware or software failures of a large system. Hence, it is crucial to understand the effect of recovery time on reliability and on overall availability in a critical control system. Dynamic Fault Tree Analysis (DFTA), Markov Chains and Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD) are presented and a block library is introduced for addressing the aforementioned modelling problems. In order to be able to evaluate dynamic fault trees and Markov Chains, Monte Carlo simulation has been used. An industry-based case study is presented, where critical failures of a redundant Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) system are identified by a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). The bottom up process of modelling control system reliability is discussed.},

abstract={Tensor decomposition models play an increasingly important role in modern data science applications. One problem of particular interest is fitting a low-rank Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition model when the tensor has sparse structure and the tensor elements are nonnegative count data. SparTen is a high-performance C++ library which computes a low-rank decomposition using different solvers: a first-order quasi-Newton or a second-order damped Newton method, along with the appropriate choice of runtime parameters. Since default parameters in SparTen are tuned to experimental results in prior published work on a single real-world dataset conducted using MATLAB implementations of these methods, it remains unclear if the parameter defaults in SparTen are appropriate for general tensor data. Furthermore, it is unknown how sensitive algorithm convergence is to changes in the input parameter values. This report addresses these unresolved issues with large-scale experimentation on three benchmark tensor data sets. Experiments were conducted on several different CPU architectures and replicated with many initial states to establish generalized profiles of algorithm convergence behavior.},

abstract={The increasing complexity of real time software has led to a recent trend in the use of high level modeling languages for development of real time software. One representative example is the modeling language ROOM (real time object oriented modeling), which provides features such as object orientation, state machine description of behaviors, formal semantics for executability of models, and possibility of automated code generation. However these modeling languages largely ignore the timeliness aspect of real time systems, and fail to provide any guidance for a designer to a priori predict and analyze temporal behavior. We consider schedulability analysis for automated implementations of ROOM models, based on the ObjecTime toolset. This work builds on results presented by M. Saksena (1997), where we developed some guidelines for the design and implementation of real time object oriented models. Using the guidelines, we have modified the run time system library provided by the ObjecTime toolset to make it amenable to schedulability analysis. Based on the modified toolset, we show how a ROOM model can be analyzed for schedulability, taking into account the implementation overheads and structure. The analysis is validated experimentally, first using simple periodic models, and then using a large case study of a train tilting system.},

An implementation of CODOMs in a cycle-accurate full-system x86 simulator demonstrates that with the right hardware support, finer-grained protection and run-time performance can peacefully coexist.},

abstract={Mission critical embedded software for autonomous operation requires high development cost due to its long development cycle. One of the potential solutions for reducing the cost is to reuse the software developed at previous missions. Virtual machine platform such as JVM is a good example to provide code portability across various missions. Flight software in aerospace field is adopting this concept to improve reusability and eventually to reduce development cost. In this paper, we propose a Lua-based virtualization environment for spacecraft flight software. Flight software for spacecraft control consists of a few tasks that are highly autonomous. Lua is chosen as the script language for programming the control tasks. Though Lua was designed with simplicity and portability, it only supports multithreading with collaborative coroutines. To support preemptive multitasking, we implement time slicing coroutines as spacecraft control processes. New coroutine scheduler is devised and time slicing functionality is added into the scheduler. Scheduler locking and message passing with external flight software are also implemented. Instead of modifying the Lua interpreter, we have exploited the debug support APIs for our implementation. For evaluation, we have implemented the flight software virtualization environment on the flight computer. Accuracy of the time slicing scheduler is also analyzed.},

abstract={Effective distributed application performance management infrastructures are based upon the collection and management of key performance metrics including resource utilization, workload and service measurements. Without application oriented transaction service measurements, the viability and long term usability of the client/server paradigm for mission critical applications is in question. The Application Response Measurement (ARM) Application Programming Interface (API) addresses this requirement by enabling the measurement of transaction level metrics, notably response time, for distributed applications through application code instrumentation. Version 2.0 of the ARM API includes the ability to measure and correlate response time components on different processors (i.e., clients and sewers). ARM Agents encompass the software components responsible for interception and processing of the ARM API calls including support for response time measurement, collection and communication. This paper introduces alternatives for several important design aspects of ARM agent software that are not specified in the ARM standards documents. In particular, we consider the architecture of ARM Agent software, correlator generation and communication, and ARM data storage. We propose, implement and analyze the performance of several alternative designs. This work provides an assessment of ARM instrumentation impact on application response times as well as insights into the design issues involved. We first provide a general overview of the ARM 2.0 API and features. We then consider alternative ARM agent software designs. Next, we present measurements results for several design implementations that shed light on the overhead involved with instrumentation and the developed designs. Finally, we present conclusions and a description of future work.},

year={2007},

pages={566-568},
abstract={The controls software in use at PEP II (Stanford control program - SCP) had originally been developed in the eighties. It is very successful in routine operation but due to its internal structure it is difficult and time consuming to extend its functionality. This is problematic during machine development and when solving operational issues. Routinely, data has to be exported from the system, analyzed offline, and calculated settings have to be reimported. Since this is a manual process, it is time consuming and error-prone. Setting up automated processes, as is done for MIA (model independent analysis), is also time consuming and specific to each application. Recently, there has been a trend at light sources to use MATLAB [1] as the platform to control accelerators using a "MATLAB middle layer" [2] (MML), and so called channel access (CA) programs to communicate with the low level control system (LLCS). This has proven very successful, especially during machine development time and trouble shooting. A special CA code, named AIDA (Accelerator Independent Data Access [3]), was developed to handle the communication between MATLAB, modern software frameworks, and the SCP. The MML had to be adapted for implementation at PEP II. Colliders differ significantly in their designs compared to light sources, which poses a challenge. PEP II is the first collider at which this implementation is being done. We will report on this effort, which is still ongoing.},

Pegasus is a holistic and versatile approach spanning various decision layers composing the software stack, and exploiting the system capabilities and workloads effectively through the use of runtime autotuning. The Pegasus approach helps developers by automating tasks regarding the efficient implementation of software applications in multicore computing systems. These tasks focus on application analysis, profiling, code transformations, and the integration of runtime autotuning. Pegasus allows developers to program their strategies or to automatically apply existing strategies to software applications in order to ensure the compliance of non-functional requirements, such as performance and energy efficiency. We show how to apply Pegasus and demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness in a complex case study, which includes tasks from a smart navigation system.},

Graphics and windows are embedded in the user interface to form the basis of the interactive environment. System configuration is entered graphically, whereas system data is entered directly through tabular windows. A variety of analysis programs are provided, such as different types of load-flow solution techniques. This work demonstrates a novel use of PC-enhanced graphics capability to display real and reactive power flows by means of animation. A modular interactive expert system is an element of this environment. Popular features such as help menus and icon-selection menus are included. The modular design of this environment permits the user to interface any custom-made analysis package regardless of the computer language used. The environment has proved to be useful for educational and research purposes.<>},

abstract={Graph applications are common in scientific and enterprise computing. Recent research studies used graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate graph workloads. These applications tend to present characteristics that are challenging for single instruction multiple data (SIMD) computation. To achieve high performance, prior work studied individual graph problems, and designed device-specific algorithms and optimizations to achieve high performance. However, programmers have to expend significant manual effort, packing data and computation to make such solutions GPU-friendly. Usually, they are too complex for regular programmers, and the resultant implementations may not be portable nor perform well across platforms. To address these concerns, we present a library of software building blocks, BelRed1 which allows programmers to build GPGPU graph applications with ease. BelRed is based on the prior research of graph algorithms in linear algebra, and is implemented and optimized for the GPU platform. BelRed currently is built on top of the OpenCL framework. It consists of fundamental building blocks necessary for graph processing. This paper introduces the library and presents several case studies on how to leverage it for a variety of representative graph problems. We evaluate application performance on an AMD GPU and investigate optimization approaches to improve performance.},

abstract={While usability has proven to be an important software quality attribute, its application to APIs is still rather uncommon. Available methods for measuring software usability show significant disadvantages when applied to APIs, like the need for test users and experienced evaluators. This makes it difficult to evaluate the usability of software components, as well as to compare different software components. An API usability measurement method is needed that is both machine-computable and objective. This paper takes a first step in the direction of such a measure by identifying measurable concepts for the usability of software components, and validating these concepts against existing studies and guidelines for usability and API design.},

A declarative domain theory defines the semantics of a domain-oriented specification language and its relationship to implementation-level subroutines. Formal specification development and reuse is made accessible to users through an intuitive graphical interface that guides them in creating diagrams denoting formal specifications. Deductive program synthesis ensures that specifications are correctly implemented. This approach has been implemented in AMPHION, a generic KBSE system that targets scientific subroutine libraries. AMPHION has been applied to the domain of solar system kinematics. AMPHION enables space scientists to develop, modify, and reuse specifications an order of magnitude more rapidly than manual program development.

abstract={Recently, enterprises, organizations, and software companies are building more and more web applications to provide their services over the Internet. In order to fulfill various requirements, the complexity of web applications nowadays is increasing dramatically. As a result, the performance characteristics of web applications, including response time, throughput, etc, become more critical than before and should be taken into careful consideration. If the response time of a web application is poor, users may lose their interests even the function of the web application is correct. Therefore, how to execute performance testing on a complex web application systematically and efficiently will be an important issue. In this paper, a performance testing framework for REST-based web applications is introduced. The performance testing framework aims to provide software testers with an integrated process from test cases design, test scripts generation, to test execution. Based on the test cases designed by software testers and the appropriate software artifacts preserved by the framework (e.g., API document), the framework generates the corresponding performance test scripts, which can be executed by specific performance test tools. This helps software testers to focus more in the design of performance test cases. In addition, effort needed to understand the design and implementation of the application and to learn the operation of testing tools decrease. Thus, the efficiency of performance testing can be highly facilitated.},

abstract={The dire need to implement and adopt industry in order to stabilize supply chains, improve throughput in manufacturing processes to meet planning and scheduling needs using advanced planning and scheduling manufacturing software key enablers such as production sequencing, real time optimization, planning and scheduling, prompted this study. The aim of this study is to comparatively analyze and select from the advanced manufacturing software key enablers to be used to implement and adopt industry for a connected factory. The concurrent triangulation design was used for analyzing the data collected from industry survey questionnaires distributed. The internal consistency of the respondents from the in-depth interview was measured using reliability test results from cronbach alpha values for production scheduling software, real time optimization software, production planning software and production sequencing software were 0.99147, 0.98814, 0.97910 and 0.97095 respectively using the rule of thumb 0‚â• 0.9 excellent which showed a good index of association. A total of 450 questionnaires were distributed, retrieved and found useable. Results from phase 1 and phase 2 of the concurrent triangulation model were merged and showed that 33.78% industries were of the opinion that optimizing supply network cost and implementing a complete order allocation using production scheduling software for Industry 4.0 will speedup implementation of connected factories, 34.22 % were in support of production planning, 17.33 % were in support of real time optimization while production sequencing and 14.67% supported production sequencing manufacturing software. From the results, optimized value of alpha at 0.98241 embracing the full package of the software used to implement and adopt industry 4.0for connected factories, will help to keep pace with industry-leading digitization practices when fully implemented and adopted.},

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of advancing a code compliant single detached dwelling in Ontario, Canada to Passive House Standard energy efficiency level. The research was based on comparing energy models built with the Passive House Planning Package, and included thermal bridging calculations performed in the THERM software. For each energy model, only the effect of improved exterior insulation was isolated and analysed. Starting from the energy model built for code compliant construction, insulation thickness was then increased and air tightness improved until the energy model reached the Passive House energy efficiency level. Achieving the Passive House energy efficiency required 152 mm of exterior insulation and 420 mm of batt insulation in a double stud wall, due to poor internal volume to exterior surface area ratio for the single detached dwelling and rectangular building shape.},

We further demonstrate that simple partial evaluation is sufficient to transform into the fastest-known C code, breaking the decades-old pattern that the only fast implementations are those whose instruction-level steps were written out by hand. These techniques were used to build an elliptic-curve library that achieves competitive performance for 80 prime fields and multiple CPU architectures, showing that implementation and proof effort scales with the number and complexity of conceptually different algorithms, not their use cases. As one outcome, we present the first verified high-performance implementation of P-256, the most widely used elliptic curve. implementations from our library were included in BoringSSL to replace existing specialized code, for inclusion in several large deployments for Chrome, Android, and CloudFlare.},

Instead, a middleware system named the TMO Support Middleware (TMOSM) and an API that wraps around the execution support services of TMOSM have been established. An approach enabling further reduction of the labor in TMO programming is to let the programmer use a GUI to build structural frames of application TMO networks. The supporting tool called the Visual Studio for TMO (ViSTMO) consists of a GUI part for interactive design of TMO-network structures and a part for automated generation of C++ TMO code-frameworks. The TMO scheme contains mechanisms enabling efficient design of autonomy-rich structures of application systems and ViSTMO provides GUIs for programming the use of those mechanisms among others. The recent expansion and refinement of the functionality of and the implementation techniques used in ViSTMO are discussed in this paper.},

pages={638-642},
abstract={Static testing is a form of software testing where the software needn't be executed and can find valuable software defects in the early stage of software development cycle. In contrast to dynamic testing, static testing performs code walkthrough automatically instead of the traditional manual way. It is primarily syntax checking of the code and this kind of software testing tool can work alone without software deployment under some strict hardware environment, so it's very convenient and hardware-saving. As it might be waste of costs to own various static testing tools and employ large number of technicians trained for using them skillfully, many small or medium sized enterprises may choose a third-party testing group for the whole or most of the testing work and is quite common in industry. Since static testing does little harm to the testing environment in contrast to dynamic testing, it's more convenient and easier to build and maintain a public software testing platform offering static testing service supplied by static testing tool built-in which can have many static testing jobs running at one time for different customers who can make their access via Internet. In this way, customers can cut their cost on software testing and get testing result with high quality. This paper presents a cloud-based platform architecture offering static testing service which can be fetched via popular Internet browsers such as IE and Fire fox. According to the design, customers should compress the software to be tested and then send upload this package to the platform with the help of browsers and then start testing execution step by step through the web page and finally can download testing result from remote server. This architecture now has an implementation in use, which is built on Hadoop and HBase both deployed on cluster of servers whose operation system are Windows, using Mapreduce implementation built-in Hadoop to distribute testing tasks over different servers, and with a friendly user interface web site built up by Tomcat. The static testing tool offering static testing service on this platform is called Defect Testing System (DTS), which is a mature static testing tool working on ordinary Windows OS and is installed standalone usually, developed by Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT).},

year={2015},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1438-1445},
abstract={The mainstream of embedded software development as of today is dominated by C programming. To aid the development, hardware abstractions, libraries, kernels and lightweight operating systems are commonplace. Such kernels and operating systems typically impose a thread based abstraction to concurrency. However, in general thread based programming is hard, plagued by race conditions and dead-locks. For this paper we take an alternative outset in terms of a language abstraction, RTFM-core, where the system is modelled directly in terms of tasks and resources. In compliance to the Stack Resource Policy (SRP) model, the language enforces (well-formed) LIFO nesting of claimed resources, thus SRP based analysis and scheduling can be readily applied. For the execution onto bare-metal single core architectures, the rtfm-core compiler performs SRP analysis on the model and render an executable that is deadlock free and (through RTFM-kernel primitives) exploits the underlying interrupt hardware for efficient scheduling. The RTFM-core language embeds C-code and links to C-object files and libraries, and is thus applicable to the mainstream of embedded development. However, while the language enforces well-formed resource management, control flow in the embedded C-code may violate the LIFO nesting requirement. In this paper we address this issue by lifting a subset of C into the RTFM-core language allowing arbitrary control flow at the model level. In this way well-formed LIFO nesting can be enforced, and models ensured to be correct by construction. We demonstrate the feasibility by means of a prototype implementation in the rtfm-core compiler. Additionally, we develop a set of running examples and show in detail how control flow is handled at compile time and during run-time execution.},

abstract={This paper presents Chameleon, an adaptive software infrastructure for supporting different levels of availability requirements in a heterogeneous networked environment. Chameleon provides dependability through the use of ARMORs-Adaptive, Reconfigurable, and Mobile Objects for Reliability. Three broad classes of ARMORs are defined: Managers, Daemons, and Common ARMORs. Key concepts that support adaptive fault tolerance include the construction of fault tolerance execution strategies from a comprehensive set of ARMORs, the creation of ARMORs from a library of reusable basic building blocks, the dynamic adaptation to changing fault tolerance requirements, and the ability to detect and recover from errors in applications and in ARMORs.},

abstract={To achieve the high performance/cost ratio, the idea of combining the advantages of DSP and RISC in a single architecture is a solution for the booming and versatile embedded application systems. The existent methods that appear in many literatures all focus on the construction of mixed architecture with RISC basement. Contrary to the above, a new idea of constructing architecture with DSP basement and supplementing it with some RISC features is put up in this paper. It can exert the advantages of DSP architecture by instruction level parallelization and powerful memory access capability, and obtain RISC good high-level language support by the manners of local-homogenous register set and RISC-like pipeline. To accelerate the DSP design and optimize the system, integrated design system (IDS) is presented to complete the hardware/software co-design and co-validation. Application programs can also be rapidly developed based on the integrated development environment (IDF). The behavior level simulation of the DSP system has been completed. It is given as 150 MIPS under the condition of 0.18 /spl mu/m technology library. FPGA validation is also accomplished.},

year={1998},
volume={},
number={},
pages={250-254},
abstract={Locally and functionally distributed applications realized on different system architectures demand a universal, portable and intuitive software utility for interprocess communication. Remote Procedure Calling (RPC) fulfills these requirements but suffers unnecessarily strict synchronization and the danger of deadlocks with complex client/server relations. Using message passing to avoid the inherent problems of RPC, however requires additional knowledge and sometimes a complete structural redesign. This paper presents NoWait-RPC, an extended but fully compatible version of SUN's Open Network Computing Group's ONC RPC, which adds message passing capabilities to form an easy to use programming environment for robust system integration. NoWait-RPC was developed to resolve potentially arising deadlocks in an already RPC-based complex application. It is designed to be a plug-and-play substitute for ONC RPC and consists of the library and the extended protocol compiler nwrpcgen. Additionally, applications using the asynchronous (non-blocking) features of NoWait-RPC may experience a major speedup compared to ONC RPC through pipelining calls to different servers. It has successfully been employed in a research programme dealing with the development of autonomous mobile robots.},

title={Effective and Efficient Memory Protection Using Dynamic Tainting},
year={2012},
volume={61},
number={1},
pages={87-100},
abstract={Programs written in languages allowing direct access to memory through pointers often contain memory-related faults, which cause nondeterministic failures and security vulnerabilities. We present a new dynamic tainting technique to detect illegal memory accesses. When memory is allocated, at runtime, we taint both the memory and the corresponding pointer using the same taint mark. Taint marks are then propagated and checked every time a memory address m is accessed through a pointer p; if the associated taint marks differ, an illegal access is reported. To allow always-on checking using a low overhead, hardware-assisted implementation, we make several key technical decisions. We use a configurable, low number of reusable taint marks instead of a unique mark for each allocated area of memory, reducing the performance overhead without losing the ability to target most memory-related faults. We also define the technique at the binary level, which helps handle applications using third-party libraries whose source code is unavailable. We created a software-only prototype of our technique and simulated a hardware-assisted implementation. Our results show that 1) it identifies a large class of memory-related faults, even when using only two unique taint marks, and 2) a hardware-assisted implementation can achieve performance overheads in single-digit percentages.},

abstract={Multi-agent systems play an important role in modern robotics. Due to the nature of these systems, coordination among agents via communication is frequently necessary. Indeed, Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loops, or Perception-Action loops closed over a communication channel, are a critical component of multi-robot systems. However, we lack appropriate tools for simulating PAC loops. To that end, in this letter, we introduce ROS-NetSim, a ROS package that acts as an interface between robotic and network simulators. With ROS-NetSim, we can attain high-fidelity representations of both robotic and network interactions by accurately simulating the PAC loop. Our proposed approach is lightweight, modular and adaptive. Furthermore, it can be used with many available network and physics simulators by making use of our proposed interface. In summary, ROS-NetSim is (i) Transparent to the ROS target application, (ii) Agnostic to the specific network and physics simulator being used, and (iii) Tunable in fidelity and complexity. As part of our contribution, we have made available an open-source implementation of ROS-NetSim to the community.},

year={2020},

number={},
pages={254-267},
abstract={In this paper, we describe our vision to accelerate algorithms in the domain of genomic data analysis by proposing a framework called Genesis (genome analysis) that contains an interface and an implementation of a system that processes genomic data efficiently. This framework can be deployed in the cloud and exploit the FPGAs-as-a-service paradigm to provide cost-efficient secondary DNA analysis. We propose conceptualizing genomic reads and associated read attributes as a very large relational database and using extended SQL as a domain-specific language to construct queries that form various data manipulation operations. To accelerate such queries, we design a Genesis hardware library which consists of primitive hardware modules that can be composed to construct a dataflow architecture specialized for those queries. As a proof of concept for the Genesis framework, we present the architecture and the hardware implementation of several genomic analysis stages in the secondary analysis pipeline corresponding to the best known software analysis toolkit, GATK4 workflow proposed by the Broad Institute. We walk through the construction of genomic data analysis operations using a sequence of SQL-style queries and show how Genesis hardware library modules can be utilized to construct the hardware pipelines designed to accelerate such queries. We exploit parallelism and data reuse by utilizing a dataflow architecture along with the use of on-chip scratchpads as well as non-blocking APIs to manage the accelerators, allowing concurrent execution of the accelerator and the host. Our accelerated system deployed on the cloud FPGA performs up to 19.3√ó better than GATK4 running on a commodity multi-core Xeon server and obtains up to 15√ó better cost savings. We believe that if a software algorithm can be mapped onto a hardware library to utilize the underlying accelerator(s) using an already-standardized software interface such as SQL, while allowing the efficient mapping of such interface to primitive hardware modules as we have demonstrated here, it will expedite the acceleration of domainspecific algorithms and allow the easy adaptation of algorithm changes.},

abstract={The demands for more powerful products and the huge capacity of today' s silicon technology move system-on-chip (SoC) designs from the leading-age to mainstream design practice. The one at the very top of the list of challenges to be solved for SoC design is verification. General agreement among many observers is that verification consumes at least 70 percent of whole design percent. SoC verification involves in multi-levels: IP level verification, chip level verification, and hardware/software (HW/SW) co-verification. The last one is the key point to the whole verification process, and some of EDA vendors have provided several EDA tools for HW/SW co-verification. In this paper, the author analyses the architecture of co-verification and the weakness of existing EDA tools, then presents a practical verification strategy based on FPGA, which is more flexible and convenient, and more efficient than traditional verification methods whose hardware and software verification are separate. An experimental result, VAD (video add data) SoC verification, is given as well finally},

abstract={Constrained interval type-2 (CIT2) fuzzy sets are a class of type-2 fuzzy sets that has been recently proposed as a way to extend type-1 membership functions to interval type-2 (IT2) while keeping a semantic connection between the IT2 fuzzy set and the concept it models. Recent work has shown how their mathematical properties can be used to design CIT2 fuzzy logic systems that are able to provide explanations for their outputs. Although the CIT2 representation can be a valuable alternative to the IT2 one, no software library for their implementation is available for the research community. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new Java library, Juzzy Constrained, that has been developed as an extension of the popular type-1 and type-2 Java toolkit Juzzy, adding support for CIT2 sets and systems. Throughout the paper, the main classes and the structure of the new library are described, together with a working example that illustrates how to build a CIT2 fuzzy system from scratch and how it can be used to produce explanations for the output.},

abstract={Repositories must be designed to meet the evolving and dynamic needs of software development organizations. Current software repository methods rely heavily on classification, which exacerbates acquisition and evolution problems by requiring costly classification and domain analysis efforts before a repository can be used effectively. This paper outlines an approach in which minimal initial structure is used to effectively find relevant software components while methods are employed to incrementally improve repository structures. The approach is demonstrated through PEEL, a tool to semi-automatically identify reusable components, and CodeFinder, a retrieval system that compensates for the lack of explicit knowledge structures through spreading activation retrieval and allows component representations to be incrementally improved while users are searching for information. The combination of these techniques yields a flexible software repository that minimizes up-front costs and improves its retrieval effectiveness as developers use it to find reusable software artifacts.},

In this paper we report the design and implementation of a soft-real time CR MAC, consisting of multiple secondary users, in a frequency hopping (FH) primary scenario. This MAC is capable of sensing the spectrum and dynamically allocating the available frequency bands to multiple CR users based on their QoS requirements. As the primary is continuously hopping, a method has also been implemented to detect the hop instant of the primary network. Synchronization usually requires real time support, however we have been able to achieve this with a soft-real time technique which enables a fully software implementation of CR MAC layer. We demonstrate the wireless transmission and reception of video over this CR testbed through opportunistic spectrum access. The experiments carried out use an open source software defined radio package called GNU Radio and a basic radio hardware component USRP.},

pages={1-10},
abstract={Component-based design can encapsulate and isolate state and the operations on it, but timing semantics crosscut these boundaries when a real-time task‚Äôs control flow spans multiple components. Under priority-based scheduling, inter-component control flow should be coupled with priority information, so that task execution can be prioritized appropriately end-to-end. However, the CAmkES component architecture for the seL4 microkernel does not adequately support priority propagation across intercomponent requests: component interfaces are bound to threads that execute at fixed priorities provided at compile-time in the component specification. In this paper, we present a new library for CAmkES with a thread model that supports (1) multiple concurrent requests to the same component endpoint; (2) propagation and enforcement of priority metadata, such that those requests are appropriately prioritized; and (3) implementations of Non-Preemptive Critical Sections, the Immediate Priority Ceiling Protocol and the Priority Inheritance Protocol for components encapsulating critical sections of exclusive access to a shared resource. We measure overheads and blocking times for these new features and use existing theory to perform schedulability analysis. Evaluations on both Intel x86 and ARM platforms show that our new library allows CAmkES to provide suitable end-to-end timing for real-time systems.},

PHYSIM can compare established modulations like orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) with modern alternatives, e.g., filter bank multi-carrier, universal filtered multi-carrier, and filtered-OFDM. Additionally, PHYSIM can draw performance comparisons between new coding schemes like polar codes and more established methods like low-density parity-check codes and turbo codes. The PHYSIM graphical user interface (GUI) assists in the design of physical layer parameters. The GUI offers plots to compare the performance of PHY configurations in transmission channels. The plots display the transmitted spectra, the received constellation diagrams, as well as the modulation, bit, and frame error ratios. Hence, the PHYSIM simulation framework assists the designer of a physical layer system and helps to find PHY settings for a target application.},

abstract={In recent years, the rise of software-defined networks (SDN) have made network control more flexible, easier to set up and manage, and have provided a stronger ability to adapt to the changing demands of application development and network conditions. The network becomes easier to maintain, but also achieves improved security as a result of SDN. The architecture of SDN is designed for Control Plane and Forwarding Plane separation and uses open APIs to realize programmable control. SDN allows for the importing of third-party applications to improve network service, or even provide a new network service. In this paper, we present a defense mechanism, which can find attack packets previously identified through the Sniffer function, and once the abnormal flow is found, the protection mechanism of the Firewall function will be activated. For the capture of the packets, available libraries will be used to determine the properties and contents of the malicious packet, and to anticipate any possible attacks. Through the prediction of all latent malicious behaviors, our new defense algorithm can prevent potential losses like system failures or crashes and reduce the risk of being attacked.},

abstract={This paper describes application of the TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) performance systemreg within Helios, a code being developed for high-fidelity modeling of rotorcraft aero and structural dynamics. TAU provides information about both single processor and parallel scaling performance. Helios consists of multiple modules written in different languages - FORTRAN90, C, and C++ - that are integrated through a high-level, Python-based infrastructure. This loosely-connected implementation has the advantage that each module can be developed separately from one another, but as with any parallel code, a single poor-performing module can hinder the performance and scalability of the suite as a whole. Although Helios is still in the early stages of development, integration with TAU provides a way to investigate performance when the design can be most influenced. The paper discusses the different levels of instrumentation, from run-time at the Python level for a high-level description, to automatic compile-time instrumentation for a more detailed breakdown. In both cases, the instrumentation is automatic, requiring no manual insertion of timers on the part of the developer. We report how these tools were used to diagnose single processor performance and parallel scaling issues.},

abstract={We introduce an interactive tool called WebTA that facilitates learning through automatic critique of student source code. Our tool provides immediate feedback to students and gives them experience with test-driven development. Students receive the benefits of cognitive apprenticeship through the feedback they receive in the tool. This facilitates tight, productive cycles of inquiry, critique and learning. WebTA compiles each student submission and executes it over a series of shakedown tests. Immediate feedback is given concerning errors and warnings, coupled with suggestions for debugging. The tool performs a textual analysis of the students source code and critiques programming style based on standard programming guidelines. To encourage inquiry through test-driven development, edge-case coverage, and API compliance, students develop and submit their own tests to be evaluated by the software. We report on use of WebTA in one first-year programming course and one second-year data structures course. Lab and assignment scores have improved with WebTA, and student comments attest to the effectiveness of the tool. Preliminary results indicate students receive higher grades with WebTA. One area with mixed results is WebTAs analysis of student developed JUnit tests; this feature improved API compliance but reduced edge-case testing. With these successful initial results, we offer suggestions for future development.},

The proposed method visualizes coincidence between specification and implementation from two aspects: static checking and ordinal testing by test suites. Each of the verification is performed in a method or function basis (unit testing). In our method, each ratio of the coincidence is shown by pie charts which represent classes of the target software. Whole software is represented in a weighted digraph structure. We have prototyped a tool implemented our proposed method. We have evaluated the availability of the proposed method by applying the tool to two kinds of software: Warehouse Management Program, and a telephone directory management program. As a result, we conclude that the proposed method shows informative results.},

year={2021},

pages={595-600},
abstract={With the increasing usage of open-source software (OSS) components, vulnerabilities embedded within them are propagated to a huge number of underlying applications. In practice, the timely application of security patches in downstream software is challenging. The main reason is that such patches do not explicitly indicate their security impacts in the documentation, which would be difficult to recognize for software maintainers and users. However, attackers can still identify these ‚Äúsecret‚Äù security patches by analyzing the source code and generate corresponding exploits to compromise not only unpatched versions of the current software, but also other similar software packages that may contain the same vulnerability due to code cloning or similar design/implementation logic. Therefore, it is critical to identify these secret security patches to enable timely fixes. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based defense system called PatchRNN to automatically identify secret security patches in OSS. Besides considering descriptive keywords in the commit message (i.e., at the text level), we leverage both syntactic and semantic features at the source-code level. To evaluate the performance of our system, we apply it on a large-scale real-world patch dataset and conduct a case study on a popular open-source web server software - NGINX. Experimental results show that the PatchRNN can successfully detect secret security patches with a low false positive rate.},

abstract={Since its founding in 2003, the MIT ROV Team has been participating in the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center's International ROV Competition. This year's challenges, in recognition of the International Polar Year, include operations in environments made to resemble those found in the Polar Regions. This includes working in currents, under ice sheets and in simulated open ocean environments. The three missions, each approximately 15 minutes long and in depths of up to 20 feet, include recovery and deployment of science packages and related support structures, the collection of faunal samples and repair and maintenance work at stations under water. In keeping with its vision to look beyond the competition and push the envelope, the MIT ROV Team built on the lessons learnt during the design, construction and operation of its fourth generation ROV, MTHR, to design MIT ROV 5.0, a compact, powerful, highly maneuverable and modular robot capable of not only participating in the competition, but also performing a variety of tasks in the open environment. MIT ROV 5.0 was primarily designed to be an exploration robot meant to operate in sheltered waters, that is, with currents below one knot, lack of powerful localized turbulent flow and the absence of highly corrosive materials. The major design requirements included ease of operation, including setup, maintenance, dives and recovery, modularity, to allow quick reconfiguration to suit a variety of missions, robustness, so that it would stand up to the rigors of the open environment, small size, for greater maneuverability and low cost, for ease of reproduction. We came up with a robot that was slightly bigger than MTHR with two modular payload bays with standard connectors that could accommodate mission-specific packages. The control box contains custom designed PC-104 size circuit boards that can support a number of different actuators and thrusters and adequate space for NiMH or LiON battery packs, which can both be used. Each board can be switched easily due to extensive use of standard sizes and connection interfaces. The frame uses high strength ABS plastic side plates with LEXAN cross-struts. The tether is a single strand Kevlar-jacketed fiber-optic cable with a Kevlar support string for added security. This tether can be replaced by a regular Ethernet or CAT-V cable is the need arises. Thus the vehicle is truly modular in every way. The MIT ROV 5.0 system as designed is very easy to use. The control software can be run off virtually any computer, using the keyboard or a standard USB joystick. The vehicle itself connects to the computer using a USB-serial interface. The entire system can be setup and ready to go in under five minutes. An on-board guidance system consisting of an inertial navigation unit and a magnetic compass provide heading, attitude and position data, as well as performing station-keeping functions, allowing effective operation in currents and low-visibility conditions. MIT ROV 5.0 can also carry several different types of sensors, such as temperature, pressure and salinity, not to mention a combination of infra-red and color cameras. Payloads currently being prototyped include precision deployment and recovery modules, a sample collection package, instrument bays and an articulated manipulator arm. This capability coupled with a production cost as low as $3,000 makes MIT ROV 5.0 an extremely valuable platform for exploration, research, education, environmental monitoring and small scale repair and recovery work.},

abstract={Most video applications use specific application programming interfaces to achieve the desired functionalities. Implementing interface backends with hardware is often too expensive for low-end mobile devices, so most of the devices cope with highly optimized software implementations that employ special instruction sets. The most common approach is the utilization of SIMD processing units such as ARM NEON or Intel WMMX in mobile application processors. Fully utilizing the potential benefits of such instruction sets usually means tedious assembly coding even if vectorizing compilers have improved lately. In addition, low level APIs such as OpenMax DL have been made available to offer a standardized interface for accelerated codec functionalities. In this paper we present optimization methods and results from using a NEON instruction set and OpenMax DL API for MPEG-4 and H.264 video encoding and decoding. Although these technologies provide for significant speed-ups and reduce the burden of application designers, the serial bit stream processing bottleneck remains to be solved.},

abstract={Software ever-increasingly relies on building blocks implemented by security libraries, which provide access to evolving standards, protocols, and cryptographic primitives. These libraries are often subject to complex development models and long decision-making processes, which limit the ability of contributors to participate in the development process, hinder the deployment of scientific results and pose challenges for OS maintainers. In this paper, focusing on OpenSSL as a de-facto standard, we analyze these limits, their impact on the security of modern systems, and their significance for researchers. We propose the OpenSSL ENGINE API as a tool in a framework to overcome these limits, describing how it fits in the OpenSSL architecture, its features, and a technical review of its internals. We evaluate our methodology by instantiating libsuola, a new ENGINE providing support for emerging cryptographic standards such as X25519 and Ed25519 for currently deployed versions of OpenSSL, performing benchmarks to demonstrate the viability and benefits. The results confirm that the ENGINE API offers (1) an ideal architecture to address wide-ranging security concerns; (2) a valuable tool to enhance future research by easing testing and facilitating the dissemination of novel results in real-world systems; and (3) a means to bridge the gaps between research results and currently deployed systems.},

abstract={Network packet classification is important network kernel function to enables various network services such as Quality of Service (QoS), security and resource reservation. The OpenFlow protocol is the responsible of the packet classification, it uses a set of rules called ruleset, each rule in that rule set contain a set of matching fields. With the rapid growing of rulesets size and rule fields numbers in the modern networks, it became so difficult to classify incoming packets at reasonable speed using the classical packet classification techniques. Many modern software-based classification solutions have been proposed to accelerate packet classification in additional to hardware-based solutions. In general, to design packet classification algorithm, it is important to strike a balance between high throughput and low memory requirements. This paper proposes an R-tree based parallel many-field packet classification technique using multi-threading to classify packet into the flow it belongs to; Multi-threading has been employed to accelerate packet classification by introduce a parallelism packet classification scheme. Two main algorithms that represent the main two parts of the proposed technique have been described, first algorithm describes how to constructing R-tree from the corresponding ruleset, and the other algorithm describes the R-tree querying in parallel manner. The performance of the proposed technique has been evaluated with consideration of throughput, latency, and memory access by testing the proposed many-fields packet classification algorithms on Class-Bench rulesets. Experiment results showed that the proposed parallel query algorithm can classify packets with very good throughput, latency, and memory access compared with other many-fields packet classification solutions.},

year={2015},

pages={165-170},
abstract={Applications running on smartphones interact with the hardware and the system software differently, resulting in widely varying power consumption and hence thermal profiles. Typically, these smartphone platforms expose some hardware power control features to users, controlled through software governors such as cpufreq for dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) and cpuquiet for dynamic core selection (DCS). Operating systems on these platforms manage these governors conservatively, independent of application's performance requirement. To address this, we propose an alternative approach, which uses reinforcement learning to explore the trade-off between power saving opportunities using DVFS and DCS and application's performance at run-time. The objective is to reduce power consumption, taking into consideration dynamic power, leakage power, and the inter-dependency between temperature and power. The reinforcement learning-based control is validated as a case-study on ARM A15-based nvidia's tegra smartphone through its implementation as a run-time manager (RTM). This RTM interfaces with different hardware performance counters and the embedded Linux Operating System through (1) the cpuquiet API to select cores at run-time; and (2) the cpufreq API to scale the frequency of active cores. Experiments with mobile and high performance applications demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an average 22% (7-40%) power reduction compared to existing techniques.},

Conventional network software systems commonly based on monolithic application stack running on costly physical single-purpose servers are affected by significant problems of resource management, computing power distribution, and scalability. Such implementation is restricting applications to be reduced to smaller, independent services that can be more easily deployed, managed, and scaled dynamically; therefore, embellishing environmental uniformity across development, testing, and production. Current cloud-based infrastructure frequently runs on containers placed in Kubernetes or Docker-based cluster, and the system configuration is considerably different compared to the environment prevailed with common virtualizations. This paper discusses the usage of GraalVM, a polyglot high-performance virtual machine for JVM-based and other languages, combined with new Kubernetes native Java tailored stacked framework named Quarkus, formed from enhanced Java libraries. Moreover, our research explores GraalVM's creation of native images using Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation and Quarkus' deployment to Kubernetes. Furthermore, we examined the architectures of given systems, various performance variables, and differing memory usage cases within our academic testing environment and presented the comparison results of selected performance measures with other traditional and contemporary solutions.},

abstract={The Multithreaded Application Real-Time executor (MARTe) is a real-time framework with increasing popularity and support in the thermonuclear fusion community. It allows to run modular code in a multi-threaded environment leveraging on the current multi-core processor (CPU) technology. One application that relies on the MARTe framework is the JET tokamak WALL load limiter System (WALLS). It calculates and monitors the temperature on metal tiles, plasma facing components (PFCs) that can melt or flake if their temperature gets too high when exposed to power loads. One of the main time consuming tasks inWALLS is the calculation of thermal diffusion models in real-time. These models tend to be described by very large state-space models thus making them perfect candidates for parallelisation. MARTe's traditional approach for task parallelisation is to split the problem into several Real-Time Threads, each responsible for a self-contained sequential execution of an input-to-output chain. This is usually possible, but it might not always be practical for algorithmic or technical reasons. Also, it might not be easily scalable with an increase of the available number of CPU cores. The WorkLibrary introduces a "GPU-Iike approach" of splitting work among the available cores of modern CPUs that is (i) straightforward to use in an application, (ii) scalable with more available cores and all of this (iii) without code rewrite or recompilation. The first part of this article explains the motivation behind the library, its architecture and implementation. The second part presents a real application for WALLS, a parallel version of a large state-space model describing the 2D thermal diffusion on a JET tile.},

The AutoMod product suite from Applied Materials has been used on thousands of projects to help engineers and managers make the best decisions possible. AutoMod supports hierarchical model construction. This architecture allows users to reuse model objects in other models, decreasing the time required to build a model. In addition, recent enhancements to AutoMod's material handling template systems have increased modeling accuracy and ease-of-use.

abstract={The map-reduce model requires users to express their problem in terms of a map function that processes single records in a stream, and a reduce function that merges all mapped outputs to produce a final result. By exposing structural similarity in this way, a number of key issues associated with the design of custom computing machines including parallelisation; design complexity; software-hardware partitioning; hardware-dependency, portability and scalability can be easily addressed. We present an implementation of a map-reduce library supporting parallel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Parallelisation due to pipelining, multiple data paths and concurrent execution of FPGA/GPU hardware is automatically achieved. Users first specify the map and reduce steps for the problem in ANSI Cand no knowledge of the underlying hardware or parallelisation is needed. The source code is then manually translated into a pipelined data path which, along with the map-reduce library, is compiled into appropriate binary configurations for the processing units. We describe our experience in developing a number of benchmark problems in signal processing, Monte Carlo simulation and scientific computing as well as report on the performance of FPGA, GPU and heterogeneous systems.},

year={2017},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-7},
abstract={Technological advancements and miniaturization have made it possible for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to perform a diverse range of tasks. UAS are being used in various applications ranging from remote sensing[1] to disaster response[2] to package delivery[3]. As drones rapidly fill the airspace, there are several threats that the system can encounter. These threats include mid-air collisions, loss of remote command connection, security breach of the drone's software system and critical damage to the hardware. To ensure the integrity of the drone in flight, an interconnected UAS architecture, having a fully functional system capable of responding to these situations, is required. This paper presents a system meeting these requirements. An interconnected UAS system of systems is proposed that includes systems for onboard GPS, obstacle avoidance central control and safety response. It focuses on the coordination level that the UAS systems will need to have amongst themselves. It proposes a control system to ensure effective monitoring of UAS. The UAS system architecture is comprised of eleven systems that are essential for a safe flight. In addition, the control system includes five different systems that are involved in the decision-making process. The importance and operation of these systems are discussed in detail. The proposed UAS software architecture is capable of performing autonomous self-control. It has decision making modules that can receive data from various sensors and integrate it to provide efficient route planning and data management. The software systems monitor the area surrounding the UAV to facilitate routing and decision making. The software architecture includes self-awareness to respond to situations such as adverse climatic conditions that impact the flight capabilities of the UAS. The proposed UAS system also includes hardware to monitor and update the list of obstacles in its path. This requires the UAS to be equipped with sensors for obstacle determination and a software system that accepts the inputs from these sensors, makes decisions and performs actions, promptly. An emergency response system is included to ensure that the drone will land safely in an appropriate location, if its systems are compromised. This response system is capable of deciding the severity of the situation and sends commands to the flight control system regarding the recovery steps that should be taken. The proposed system architecture incorporates cybersecurity in its design framework so that it is equipped to handle potential hackers that might try to gain access to onboard navigation controls and reroute the UAS for personal gain or another agenda. If the system senses a threat, it launches the emergency response system. The proposed UAS software architecture includes a maintenance and diagnostics system that coordinates and monitors drone activities. It performs functions ranging from monitoring the health of the hardware systems to uploading error reports to the central server. The system transmits error reports to the control unit which further processes the data to determine the source of the error and resolve the issue. In UAS systems, a computerized framework takes input from at least one sensor, and uses a pre-characterized set of guidelines to make decisions [4]. This paper aims to achieve an interconnected UAS system of systems that can address several issues and solutions related to flight autonomously.},

abstract={In spite of the availability of a large number of commercial software packages for the analysis of electromagnetic fields, SAW devices defy a satisfying usage of these packages.

The method of moments (MoM) is particularly suitable for this class of problems, despite its deficiencies. To combat several problems in the MoM applications we have developed the method of Fast-MoM utilizing a number of universal functions. In this paper we illustrate the construction and processing of universal functions for the EM analysis in SAW devices, and point out strategies for accelerating the computations and enhancing the accuracy of the numerical results.},

year={2016},
volume={13},
number={9},
pages={208-226},
abstract={Defending against return-oriented programing (ROP) attacks is extremely challenging for modern operating systems. As the most popular mobile OS running on ARM, Android is even more vulnerable to ROP attacks due to its weak implementation of ASLR and the absence of effective control-flow integrity enforcement. In this paper, leveraging specific ARM features, an instruction randomization strategy to mitigate ROP attacks in Android even with the threat of single pointer leakage vulnerabilities is proposed. By popping out more registers in functions' epilogue instructions and reallocating registers in function scopes, branch targets in all (direct and indirect) branch instructions potential to be ROP gadgets are changed randomly. Without the knowledge of binaries' runtime instructions layout, adversary's repeated control flow transfer in ROP exploits will be subverted. Furthermore, this instruction randomization idea has been implemented in both Android Dalvik runtime and ART. Corresponding evaluations proved it is capable to introduce enough randomness for more than 99% discovered functions and thwart about 95% ROP gadgets in application's shared libraries and oat file compiled from Dalvik bytecode. Besides, evaluations on real-world exploits also confirmed its effectiveness on mitigating ROP attacks within acceptable performance overhead.},

abstract={Auto-reconfiguration and response mechanisms in IP networks are challenges that lead to enforcing the required policies in such a dynamic environment. Software-Defined Network (SDN) provides an economic architecture solution for service providers by reducing provisioning time from weeks to minutes, facilitating centralized management, allowing programmability and promoting innovation. SDN achieves this by separating the two features inside network devices, such as routers and switches, namely the control plane from the data plane. The paper presents an implementation of a web-based management system for SDN controllers. This implementation allows network operators to control and supervise quickly the virtual network functions (VNF) provided by SDN networks. The implementation not only takes advantages of open source software including Flask and Ryu frameworks, OpenvSwitch and Mininet but also supports for virtual network functions. The system emulates a network topology with simple switches and links and also acts as a management center to query commands from Ryu network application using REST API in order to monitor changes in network traffic.},

pages={2072-2085},
abstract={With the recent advancement of multilayer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fully connected networks (FCNs), deep learning has achieved amazing success in many areas, especially in visual content understanding and classification. To improve the performance and energy efficiency of the computation-demanding CNN, the FPGA-based acceleration emerges as one of the most attractive alternatives. In this paper, we design and implement Caffeine, a hardware/software co-designed library to efficiently accelerate the entire CNN and FCN on FPGAs. First, we propose a uniformed convolutional matrix-multiplication representation for both computation-bound convolutional layers and communication-bound FCN layers. Based on this representation, we optimize the accelerator microarchitecture and maximize the underlying FPGA computing and bandwidth resource utilization based on a revised roofline model. Moreover, we design an automation flow to directly compile highlevel network definitions to the final FPGA accelerator. As a case study, we integrate Caffeine into the industry-standard software deep learning framework Caffe. We evaluate Caffeine and its integration with Caffe by implementing VGG16 and AlexNet networks on multiple FPGA platforms. Caffeine achieves a peak performance of 1460 giga fixed point operations per second on a medium-sized Xilinx KU060 FPGA board; to our knowledge, this is the best published result. It achieves more than 100√ó speedup on FCN layers over prior FPGA accelerators. An end-to-end evaluation with Caffe integration shows up to 29√ó and 150√ó performance and energy gains over Caffe on a 12-core Xeon server, and 5.7√ó better energy efficiency over the GPU implementation. Performance projections for a system with a high-end FPGA (Virtex7 690t) show even higher gains.},

abstract={HARP (the Hybrid Automated Reliability Predictor) is a software package that implements advanced reliability modeling techniques. We present an overview of some of the problems that arise in modeling highly reliable fault-tolerant systems; the overview is loosely divided into model construction and model solution problems. We then describe the HARP approach to these difficulties, which is facilitated by a technique called behavioral decomposition. The bulk of this paper presents examples of the dependability evaluation of some typical fault-tolerant systems, including a local-area network, two well-known fault-tolerant computer systems (C.mmp and SIFT), and an example of a flight control system. HARP has been used to solve very large models. A system consisting of 20 components distributed among 7 stages produced a Markov chain with 24 533 states and over 335 000 transitions (without coverage). Depending on the system used to run this example, the run time took anywhere from 4 to 8 hours. HARP is undergoing beta testing at approximately 20 sites. It is written in standard FORTRAN 77, consists of nearly 30000 lines of code and comments, and has been tested under several operating systems. The graphics interface (written in C) runs on an IBM PC AT, and produces text files that can be used to solve the system on the PC (for very small systems), or can be uploaded to a larger machine. HARP is accompanied by an Introduction and Guide for Users. For information on obtaining a copy of HARP, contact one of the authors.},

abstract={Socially coupled systems are comprised of interdependent social, organizational, economic, infrastructure and physical networks. Today's urban regions serve as an excellent example of such systems. People and institutions confront the implications of the increasing scale of information becoming available due to a combination of advances in pervasive computing, data acquisition systems as well as high performance computing. Integrated modeling and decision making environments are necessary to support planning, analysis and counter factual experiments to study these complex systems. Here, we describe SIMFRASTRUCTURE - a flexible coordination middleware that supports high performance computing oriented decision and analytics environments to study socially coupled systems. Simfrastructure provides a multiplexing mechanism by which simple and intuitive user-interfaces can be plugged in as front-end systems, and high-end computing resources can be plugged in as back-end systems for execution. This makes the computational complexity of the simulations completely transparent to the users. The decoupling of user interfaces and data repository from simulation execution allows users to access simulation results asynchronously and enables them to add new datasets and simulation models dynamically. Simfrastructure enables implementation of a simple yet powerful modeling environment with built-in analytics-as-a service platform, which provides seamless access to high end computational resources, through an intuitive interface for studying socially coupled systems. We illustrate the applicability of Simfrastructure in the context of an integrated modeling environment to study public health epidemiology.},

abstract={PANACEA is a software package that significantly extends the range of Markovian queueing networks that are computationally tractable. It solves multi-class closed, open, and mixed queueing networks. Based on an underlying theory of integral representations and asymptotic expansions, PANACEA solves queueing networks that are orders of magnitude larger than can be solved by other established algorithms. The package is finding widespread use in Bell Laboratories. It also has important software innovations. A flexible programming-language-like interface facilitates compact representation of large queueing networks. An out-of-core implemental strategy enables PANACEA to be ported to processors with modest memory. The modular structure of this software package, along with the automatic machine-generated parser, makes it easily extendable. This paper provides an overview of two basic versions of PANACEA, versions 1.0 and 1.1, which solve ‚Äúclosed‚Äù networks only. A description of its model language is given from the point of view of its capability to describe queueing networks in a compact, natural manner.

Real-time data from instruments and positioning sensors is made available by using a publishing mechanism and a remote data server. Users with Internet or intranet access can subscribe to any real-time data field being published and receive updates every time the information changes. Underwater infrastructure information resulting from construction, maintenance and inspection is often stored in databases. The software libraries introduced in this paper also provide a full set of tools to store and retrieve information from such databases. The database access tools use the same publish and subscribe mechanism involved in real-time data acquisition. This similarity makes it very easy for developers to integrate historic and live data in a single monitoring application. The visualization tools presented in this paper enable developers to define virtual scenes that can display all the relevant elements associated with an underwater construction job, including complex structures and dynamic objects; i.e., ROVs, vessels, etc. The use of advance cueing techniques and multi-resolution rendering make it possible to achieve satisfactory interactive frame rates without sacrificing accuracy and realism. The concept of 3D indicator modules is also introduced. These powerful modules can be linked to live data using the subscribe tools and attached to any element in the environment including dynamic ones. This flexibility allows the users to monitor the data, not only as it changes, but also in the 3D location that makes the most sense. The three components of the tools being introduced in this paper (data acquisition, data distribution, and scene visualization) are fully described along with examples of applications that take full advantage of the integration of all three components.},

abstract={Building electronic circuits is one of the most common hands-on activities in learning STEM subjects. Beginning students often find it difficult to translate a circuit schematic into the construction of the physical circuit on a breadboard. In this paper, we describe an Augmented Reality circuit learning software that can provide students with step-by-step instructions by placing virtual circuit components on a physical breadboard. We propose a novel image processing pipeline that can robustly identify the planar structure of a breadboard, even in the presence of occluding circuit components on the breadboard. Using a commercially available library of 3D circuit component models, the estimated 3D structure of the breadboard allows us to render arbitrary circuit components on it in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms are accurate and can produce realistic-looking virtual circuits.},
