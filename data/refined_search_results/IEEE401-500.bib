abstract={Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) serve a wide variety of purposes in the development of complex applications. The Internet of Things (IoT) brings additional complexity to software development due to its inherent distribution and inclusion of a massive number of heterogeneous devices (sensors and actuators). The process of developing software architectures for IoT involves the interaction of several components that play distinct roles. In this paper, we propose a language called BIoTA (Buildout IoT Application Language), a DSL whose objective is to assist and streamline the building of software architectures for IoT. The specification and implementation of the BIoTA language involve a grammar and a compiler, responsible for syntax and semantic analysis, as well as code generation. They facilitate the formalization of software architectures using automata, which would otherwise be created in an informal and ad-hoc manner to address specific IoT scenarios. We developed an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) capable of reading and creating software architectures using the BIoTA language. With the BIoTA IDE, we demonstrate three examples of software architectures for IoT smart applications in public buildings, irrigation, and parking. The IDE also makes it possible to export architectures to a software distribution package pattern based on containers (Docker Compose) for future deployment.},

Our model defines a mapping of how the fundamental concepts of component-based development (CBD) should be implemented using the object-oriented (OO) constructs, available in the Java programming language. The benefit of this mapping is to shorten the distance between component-based software architecture and its implementation, enhancing the reusability, adaptability and maintainability of component-based software systems.},

abstract={Implementing a solution for a design decision that precisely satisfies the trade-off between quality attributes can be extremely challenging. Further, typically quality attribute trade-offs are not represented as first-class entities in development artifacts. Hence, decisions might be sub-optimal and lack requirements traceability as well as changeability. We propose Trade-off-oriented Development (ToD), a new concept to automate the selection and integration of reusable implementations for a given design decision based on quality attribute trade-offs. Implementations that vary in quality attributes and that solve reoccurring design decisions are collected in a design decision library. Developers declaratively specify the quality attribute trade-off, which is then used to automatically select the best fitting implementation. We argue that thereby, software could satisfy the trade-offs more precisely, requirements are traceable and changeable, and advances in implementations automatically improve existing software.},

abstract={A hardware-software codesign environment provides the designer with an environment in which the designer can concurrently develop the hardware and software components of the system to satisfy a given set of performance and design constraints. As a design evolves from the conceptual level model of the hardware-software system, to the final implementation, the design progresses through a number of design steps and design environments. There exists a need for a single uniform design environment for specifying design information as it develops. In this paper, we describe our work to use VHDL to build design libraries that support rapid system prototyping and conceptual modeling as software components. Furthermore, the design libraries have been linked with a graphical codesign environment. This graphical environment provides a single framework in which the designer can (i) build the design, (ii) simulate the design for correctness, and (iii) visualize performance results and capacity measures.},

abstract={The complex process of adapting pre-packaged applications, such as Oracle or SAP, to an organization's needs is full of challenges. Although detailed, structured, and well-documented methods govern this process, the consulting team implementing the method must spend a huge amount of manual effort to make sure the guidelines of the method are followed as intended by the method author. MATCON breaks down the method content, documents, templates, and work products into reusable objects, and enables them to be cataloged and indexed so these objects can be easily found and reused on subsequent projects. By using models and meta-modeling the reusable methods, we automatically produce a CASE tool to apply these methods, thereby guiding consultants through this complex process. The resulting tool helps consultants create the method deliverables for the initial phases of large customization projects. Our MATCON output, referred to as Consultant Assistant, has shown significant savings in training costs, a 20 - 30% improvement in productivity, and positive results in large Oracle and SAP implementations.},

abstract={This paper summarizes the status of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) software communications architecture (SCA). As the result of steps taken by the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO) and the Modular Software-programmable Radio Consortium (MSRC), the SCA is at a level of maturity that ensures the goals of the JTRS program can be met. The SCA defines the framework for JTRS implementations in a manner that provides for communications interoperability, portability of application programs, and the ability to leverage commercial development and product availability into JTRS procurements. Key features of the SCA are the core software framework interfaces defined in a standard interface definition language (IDL), communication waveform application program interfaces (APIs) and API building blocks, and requirements for embedded INFOSEC and for INFOSEC APIs. The JTRS JPO has contracted with multiple vendors to implement these elements to validate the architecture. The results have shown that the architecture can be implemented in multiple products providing interoperable communications and that waveforms can be ported between different implementations with greatly reduced effort compared to that required in current radio designs. The SCA is designed and expected to grow as systems are procured and experience is gained with fielded equipment. The efforts to date show that the SCA meets or exceeds the goals and expectations of the JTRS JPO in defining the framework on which to base those equipment designs.},

abstract={This paper introduces an original software engineering methodology we developed while focusing on the implementation of a low-level image processing library targeted for a shared memory multi-processor DSP architecture: the TMS320C80. Real-time constraints led us to concentrate on the enhancement of data locality thanks to the software managing of caches based on an advanced multi-dimensional DMA. This contribution compares to other existing C80's image processing libraries in terms of genericity, flexibility and performance improvement. Our approach allows for the composing of concurrent processing chains grounded on a modular library gathering basic processing operators. Generic mechanisms allow to address all basic operator's requirements as well as to quickly expand the library thanks to a re-usable and well defined framework. Flexibility allows to dynamically re-configure a chain or to modify the region of interest and the number of processors. We finally demonstrate experimentally that our approach allows significant performance improvements.},

Six simulation tools - five well-known commercial tools and one developed in-house - are compared with each other for four different planar antennas. It is crucial to point out that all possible efforts have been made to guarantee the most optimal use of each of the software packages, to study in detail any discrepancies between the solvers, and to assess the remaining simulation challenges. The study clearly highlights the importance of understanding EM simulation principles and their inherent limitations for antenna designers. Finally, some designing guidelines are provided that also can simplify the initial selection of EM solvers.},

This paper designs a lightweight runtime environment of ROS nodes onto mid-range embedded devices. Our environment, that is named to mROS, consists of a real-time OS and TCP/IP protocol stack to provide a tiny ROS communication library. mROS provides the connectivity to host and other ROS nodes with the native ROS network protocol. One of advantages for mROS is that native ROS nodes can be ported from Linux-based systems to RTOS-based systems since APIs with the same name of native ROS can be used in the embedded program. Experimental results validate that the performance requirement of mROS can be achieved for the construction of distributed robot systems.},

Then, appropriate components are retrieved from a repository, subjected to restricted modifications if necessary and "glued" together following the architectural guidelines. Finally, a version of a system is automatically packaged from the selected components and the architectural specifications.

abstract={We present a new active model-learning approach to generating abstractions of a system implementation, as finite state automata (FSAs), from execution traces. Given an implementation and a set of observable system variables, the generated automata admit all system behaviours over the given variables and provide useful insight in the form of invariants that hold on the implementation. To achieve this, the proposed approach uses a pluggable model learning component that can generate an FSA from a given set of traces. Conditions that encode a completeness hypothesis are then extracted from the FSA under construction and used to evaluate its degree of completeness by checking their truth value against the system using software model checking. This generates new traces that express any missing behaviours. The new trace data is used to iteratively refine the abstraction, until all system behaviours are admitted by the learned abstraction. To evaluate the approach, we reverse-engineer a set of publicly available Simulink Stateflow models from their C implementations.},

abstract={Deep convolutional neural networks were used to successfully segment several important neural tissue classes in MRI brain images, and approaches for integrating prior information into the networks to increase their performance on this task were investigated. Regrettably, only the first of them is addressed in this paper. To make the implementation of nonstandard architectures, which was expected to be required for the second goal, it was determined to provide a framework for defining and training networks by only using fundamental components. While this was an educational experience, the amount of progress accomplished was far less than if a conventional network package had been utilized instead. The requirement to deal with all of the lowest level aspects of network construction, from initialization schemes to adaptive learning rates and all the other components of the optimizer pipeline has left no time for utilizing this infrastructure to do something which has not been accomplished by the existing frameworks, and of course in all other respects it is far more limited than they are. It would in-stead be focused on a clear and detailed analysis of the full pipeline, which is required to build a network for solving the first problem. Despite several difficulties tracking down bugs in the optimizer, GPU memory allocation, and the last-minute accidental deletion of a large portion of the experimental results, the software implementation made available at: achieves DICE results of 0:8, which, while not class leading, would still place well in many benchmarks.},

abstract={Dealing with crosscutting requirements in software development usually makes the process more complex. Modeling and analyzing of these requirements in the software architecture facilitate detecting architectural risks early. Distributed systems have more complexity and so these facilities are much useful in development of such systems. Aspect oriented Architectural Description Languages (ADD) have emerged to represent solutions for discussed problems; nevertheless, imposing radical changes to existing architectural modeling methods is not easily acceptable by architects. Software architecture analysis methods, furthermore, intend to verify that the quality requirements have been addressed properly. In this paper, we enhance ArchC# through utilization of aspect features with an especial focus on Non-Functional Requirements (NFR). ArchC# is mainly focused on describing architecture of distributed systems; in addition, it unifies software architecture with an object- oriented implementation to make executable architectures. Moreover, in this paper, a comparative analysis method is presented for evaluation of the result. All of these materials are illustrated along with a case study.},

In adapting modules to the MUPE-2 environment, the authors have changed their design and implementation. In particular, they have added a module type, called the supermodule, that can encapsulate related modules, so that the architecture of a software system may be captured, and unified the separate definition and implementation parts of a module into a single module, called the DefImp module, so that some consistency problems due to textual separation can be avoided. They examine the role of modules in a batch environment and give a rationale for their design of modules for integrated environments.<>},

abstract={Structural analysis is a key part of the engineering design that structural engineers use to ensure that a structure can resist the different types of forces that it will encounter during its operation. Many powerful and popular structural software are available in this engineering field. Building information modelling (BIM) is one of the most promising recent developments in the Engineering field. Employing BIM enhanced the building design process by introducing new avenues for collaboration among multi-disciplinary designers. Currently, different BIM software packages are used by the multidisciplinary designers. However, not much information can be found in the BIM model that structural engineers can benefit from. Moreover, the structural software programs have not adopted the philosophy of BIM on the framework of the software.The objective of this study is to use BIM technology for analysis of the building structural model. This study is limited to find the reactions of the supports, as a structural element, in the BIM model. Therefore, a new application âSupport Reactions applicationâ is implemented, which was created by using Microsoft C# programming language. This application was integrated and interfaced with Autodesk Revit by using the Revit API (Application programming interface). As a result, this new add-in makes its users free from using any other structural software to find the supports reactions in the BIM model.},

abstract={An increasing number of organisations are procuring off-the-shelf systems from commercial suppliers. However, successful selection of off-the-shelf systems to fit customer requirements remains problematic. The London Ambulance Service fiasco in 1992 is a well-known example of system failure due, at least in part, to poor product selection. New methods and techniques for requirements acquisition and product selection are needed. The authors propose a new method which integrates techniques from several disciplines in response to lessons learned from a complex commercial off-the-shelf product selection exercise undertaken by the authors. They report on a recent experience in selecting a complex commercial off-the-shelf software system to be compliant with over 130 customer requirements, and lessons learned from the experience.

abstract={A large number of computer programs are discussed in the scientific literature for the implementation of most digital signal processing algorithms. The reader interested in evaluating this type of algorithm is often discouraged by the time and effort he has to spend interfacing the algorithm to his particular processing environment. This paper presents a software testbed package called the Digital Signal Processing Interactive System (DSPIS) which was designed to be a unified and consistent environment for the evaluation of digital signal processing algorithms. Input and output data are confined to seven vectors: X, Y and V for time domain, A, B and W for spectral domain and, finally, C for coefficient domain. Data can be synthesized or transferred from a file into one of the vectors, processed by one or more algorithms and the results (in one or many vectors) can be stored in files. Any vector can be printed out or displayed against its scaled index (except the vector C). DSPIS is menu oriented and permits interactive execution of commands.},

abstract={Software engineering is continuously facing the challenges of growing complexity of software packages and increased level of data on defects and drawbacks from software production process. This makes a clarion call for inventions and methods which can enable a more reusable, reliable, easily maintainable and high quality software systems with deeper control on software generation process. Quality and productivity are indeed the two most important parameters for controlling any industrial process. Implementation of a successful control system requires some means of measurement. Software metrics play an important role in the management aspects of the software development process such as better planning, assessment of improvements, resource allocation and reduction of unpredictability. The process involving early detection of potential problems, productivity evaluation and evaluating external quality factors such as reusability, maintainability, defect proneness and complexity are of utmost importance. Here we discuss the application of CK metrics and estimation model to predict the external quality parameters for optimizing the design process and production process for desired levels of quality. Estimation of defect-proneness in object-oriented system at design level is developed using a novel methodology where models of relationship between CK metrics and defect-proneness index is achieved. A multifunctional estimation approach captures the correlation between CK metrics and defect proneness level of software modules.},

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Coding (NC) are two key concepts in networking that have garnered much attention in recent years. On the one hand, SDN's potential to virtualize services in the Internet allows a large flexibility not only for routing data, but also to manage buffering, scheduling, and processing over the network. On the other hand, NC has shown great potential for increasing robustness and performance when deployed on intermediate nodes in the network. This new paradigm changes the dynamics of network protocols, requiring new designs that exploit its potential. This paper advocates for the use of SDN to bring about future Internet and 5G network services by incorporating NC functionalities. The inherent flexibility of both SDN and NC provides a fertile ground to envision more efficient, robust, and secure networking designs, that may also incorporate content caching and storage, all of which are key challenges of the future Internet and the upcoming 5G networks. This paper proposes some of the keys behind this intersection and supports it with use cases as well as a an implementation that integrated the Kodo library (NC) into OpenFlow (SDN). Our results on single-hop, multi-hop, and multi-path scenarios show that gains of 3x to 11x are attainable over standard TCP and Multi-Path TCP.},

abstract={To increase the efficiency of a commercial gold electroplating operation, researchers analyzed historical data for the electroplating baths and developed bath management tools and strategies using statistics and systems design methods. The past process was operating outside of established process specification limits; therefore management desired easy-to-use tools for tracking bath chemical levels and determining chemical adjustments to keep the baths within specifications. After consultation with personnel, the project team accomplished this goal by creating a software tool that was integrated into the initial system. The software tool combines lab data storage, specification chart generation, and stoichiometry in a robust Visual Basic package running inside of Microsoft Excel. Upon the conclusion of this project, the company expects to see improvements in interdepartmental communication, value-added laboratory utilization, and overall part quality. Potential quantitative benefits include a reduction in the annual cost of poor quality, currently estimated at $400,000 for the electroplating process.},

First, we present various filter algorithms and introduce the mathematical constructs needed to include them into SPIRAL's architecture. Then we use SPIRAL to find fast filter implementations. The results show runtime improvements to a standard loop implementation of up to 70% using different blocking techniques. Further, we show that the usefulness of frequency-domain methods is not determined by the number of operations.},

abstract={Platforms, frameworks, and other forms of software assets are proliferating in the industry for well-documented reasons.

Each asset provides the ability to fulfill a set of requirements, and imposes a set of constraints. Given these complex compatibility relationships, it is a non-trivial task to determine how best to utilize candidate assets toward a defined business problem. This task is made harder when multiple stakeholders from various backgrounds contribute to the decision-making process, as often occurs in large projects.By grouping requirements by functional area, and relating them to corresponding candidate technologies, we propose an approach that allows stakeholders to collaboratively reason about the satisfaction of requirements, the compatibility of technologies, and integration risk. The goal is to narrow the initial space of technologies to a smaller number of viable candidate technology sets.},

The small amount of RL-tools focused on robotics, plus the lack of features such as easy transfer of simulated environments to real hardware, are obstacles to the widespread use of RL in robotic applications. FRobs_RL is a Python library that aims to facilitate the implementation, testing, and deployment of RL algorithms in intelligent robotic applications using robot operating system (ROS), Gazebo, and OpenAI Gym. FRobs_RL provides an Application Programming Interface (API) to simplify the creation of RL environments, where users can import a wide variety of robot models as well as different simulated environments. With the FRobs_RL library, users do not need to be experts in ROS, Gym, or Gazebo to create a realistic RL application. Using the library, we created and tested two environments containing common robotic tasks; one is a reacher task using a robotic manipulator, and the other is a mapless navigation task using a mobile robot. The library is available in GitHub 1.},

pages={155-166},
abstract={Object-oriented paradigm promises a high level of reusability in software development. However, by just selecting an object-oriented programming language does not guarantee achieving highly reusable software components. Reusable components have to be designed carefully from the early stage of software development. Among many proposed guidelines for improving software reusability, "class independence" is regarded as an important criterion. The guidelines in this category state that the less dependence the class is, the more reusable the class is. However we argue that the use of these guidelines is often very difficult to follow consistently within a group of designers during the design process. This is because the implementation of such guidelines is highly based on individual designer's interpretation and experience. Another problem is that such guidelines are difficult to apply to a large software system, which may consist of hundreds or even thousands of classes. This paper describes a new notation, called the Hierarchical Dependence Diagram (HDD), to support a more systematic use of "components independence" guidelines by extending reusable classes to "clusters", "libraries", and "platforms". Our work establishes a solid basis for tool support for improving reusability and can be more effectively applied to the development of large object-oriented software systems.},

To address this, we propose a correct-by-construction modular chip design approach, which allows chips to be constructed from a component library and verified by simulation before fabrication.

Currently, inter-library loan (ILL) is a cumbersome and manual process. Our system helps promote resource-sharing and interoperability and reduces the difficulties involved in the current manual loan system between libraries.

This paper proposes a new process for multiple COTS selection based on extension of a proven system decomposition technique FCD. During the process of decomposition, local requirements are allocated into functional modules as local evaluation criteria for COTS candidates while crosscutting requirements are considered later in global selection. Due to the hierarchical structure of FCD, COTS products with varying granularities are considered. COTS candidates are evaluated through analyzing the gap between COTS features and requirements and fitness score is calculated based on the gap and adjustment cost which are measured by function points. Those COTS products with fitness score higher than a pre-defined threshold keep going into the global selection phase. In global selection, combinations of candidate COTS products for modules are evaluated based on crosscutting requirements.},

We argue that constrained genericity is not really the appropriate mechanism for this purpose since it restricts a generic class to one kind of use for each element type. We introduce the concept of 'generic procedure parameters' which allow the properties of a collection class to be specified in the instantiation rather than via the properties of the elements. We show that the concept is very efficiently implementable, more powerful than constrained genericity and more useful for the practical construction of complex data collections.},

abstract={The ATLAS experiment observes proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC accelerator at CERN. The ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system selects interesting events on-line in a three-level trigger system in order to store them at a budgeted rate of several hundred Hz, for an average event size of ~1.5 MB. This paper focuses on the TDAQ data-logging system and in particular on the implementation and performance of a novel software design, reporting on the effort of exploiting the full power of multi-core hardware. In this respect, the main challenge presented by the data-logging workload is the conflict between the largely parallel nature of the event processing, including the recently introduced on-line event-compression, and the constraint of sequential file writing and checksum evaluation. This is further complicated by the necessity of operating in a fully data-driven mode, to cope with continuously evolving trigger and detector configurations. In this paper we will briefly discuss our development experience using recent concurrency-oriented libraries. We will then concentrate on the results of performance measurements performed on the current data-logging hardware. We will show that, even in the worst workload, the new parallel design is able to compete with the previous single-threaded one, while it is outperforming it in more favourable, realistic workloads. We will as well demonstrate the minimal overhead introduced by the above parallel techniques, considering the whole data-logging software performances with respect to the bare processing speed on the same hardware. Finally, we will discuss the effects of simultaneous multi-threading technologies, as found on recent CPUs. The data-logging operation in fact, mixing data processing and I/O, allows to efficiently exploit the features provided by these technologies.},

abstract={Microprogramming is one technique for designing the control unit of a digital computer or computer-based instrument. It has become more widely used than a conventional hardwired logic design technique due to its flexibility and simplicity. We have developed an educational software package for the microprogramming simulation based on a computer architecture defined in a popular undergraduate computer engineering textbook [1]. This software package consists of an assembler, a compiler, and a simulator. The assembler translates a conventional assembly-language program into a macro object file, while the compiler compiles a microprogram into a micro object file. The simulator shows how a macroinstruction is interpreted by executing a series of microinstructions. The simulator is interactive, flexible, and easy to use. This software package, written in standard Pascal, is available for distribution to interested institutions.},

It utilizes the Kinect sensor's image input parts (IR projector and IR camera) for computer vision along with an open source software called Processing for reception and analysis of input data to decision making on what actions and steps to perform, and even for communicating with the database. A MySQL database will be responsible for holding the information of the system and to handle them (adding, deleting, retrieving, etc....). Even though the system will be designed for a library to display information about the books available in it, however the proposed system design will be broad enough to allow its implementation in many other domains, making people's lives more efficient and innovative. Implementation steps are listed along with a detailed explanation of how the system works.

year={2015},

number={},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Currently electrical products such as smart phone and tablet, light weight and thin feature of them are definitely required. To achieve several requirements, size of IC package assembled in limiting space become more crucial and development orientated. Microelectronics products of FCCSP (Flip Chip-Chip Scale Package) with more increasing challenges are countered to assure molding capability with rapidly advancing encapsulation process in flip chip technology such as decreasing bump height and bump pitch, especially when Molded Underfill (MUF) is used and in particular during transfer molding process. Moldflow simulation is valid method to predict and resolve in air void entrapment severely occurred under the die (air void concentrated within bump region). Optimum solutions would be found out for air void risk free of MUF FCCSP with different bump structure or die size design, which can reduce development cycle time before mass production. In this paper, two molding flow factors for void prediction will be performed by moldflow simulation software. One of the two is about characteristics of bump structure including bump height and bump pitch. By varying different bump dimensions, melt-front position of molding frontier is affected in relevantly significant. In addition, the other factor is package with different die size design. Die size also presents obvious influence on melt-front pattern while molding compound flow through region under die. From this study, some results can be concluded for getting improvement on mold flow performance of MUF FCCSP package during molding process. The first of all is MUF FCCSP with the 58um bump height and 100um bump pitch will perform low air void risk since there is more space under die letting compound flow though more easily. Based on the same concept mention previously, the second one is smaller die arrangement that also can be benefit to compound flowing and get better pattern of melt-front. Finally, the simulation results provide a prediction guideline that MUF FCCSP with suitable bump height/pitch and die size structure condition to prevent void issue occur under die region during molding process.},

abstract={Modularity determines software quality in terms of evolvability, changeability, maintainability, etc. and a module could be a vertical slicing through source code directory structure or class boundary. Given a modularized design, we need to determine whether its implementation realizes the designed modularity. Manually comparing source code modular structure with abstracted design modular structure is tedious and error-prone. In this paper, we present an automated approach to check the conformance of source code modularity to the designed modularity. Our approach uses design structure matrices (DSMs) as a uniform representation; it uses existing tools to automatically derive DSMs from the source code and design, and uses a genetic algorithm to automatically cluster DSMs and check the conformance. We applied our approach to a small canonical software system as a proof of concept experiment. The results supported our hypothesis that it is possible to check the conformance between source code structure and design structure automatically, and this approach has the potential to be scaled for use in large software systems.},

year={2009},
volume={},
number={},
pages={864-872},
abstract={The Internet has become a cost-effective vehicle for software development and release, particular in the free software community. Given the free nature of this software, there are often a number of users motivated by altruism to help out with the distribution, so as to promote the healthy development of this voluntary society. It is thus naturally expected that a peer-to- peer distribution can be implemented, which will scale well with large user bases, and can easily explore the network resources made available by the volunteers. Unfortunately, this application scenario has many unique characteristics, which make a straightforward adoption of existing peer-to-peer systems for file sharing (such as BitTorrent) suboptimal. In particular, a software release often consists of a large number of packages, which are difficult to distribute individually, but the archive is too large to be distributed in its entirety. The packages are also being constantly updated by the loosely-managed developers, and the interest in a particular version of a package can be very limited depending on the computer platforms and operating systems used. In this paper, we propose a novel peer-to-peer assisted distribution system design that addresses the above challenges. It enhances the existing distribution systems by providing compatible and yet more efficient downloading and updating services for software packages. Our design leads to apt-p2p, a practical implementation that extends the popular apt distributor. apt-p2p has been used in conjunction with Debian-based distribution of Linux software packages and is also available in the latest release of Ubuntu. We have addressed the key design issues in apt-p2p, including indexing table customization, response time reduction, and multi-value extension. They together ensure that the altruistic users' resources are effectively utilized and thus significantly reduces the currently large bandwidth requirements of hosting the software, as confirmed by our existing real user statistics gathered over the Internet.},

abstract={As we connect more microcontrollers to the Internet and employ them to control the physical world around us, their reliability and security are increasingly important. Many microcontrollers provide limited facilities for hardware isolation, and real-time OSes offer custom APIs, that require coupling applications into the ecosystem and abstractions of that specific OS to leverage isolation. This article investigates the use of software sandboxing of applications to support isolation for resource-constrained devices. Toward this, we detail the design of eWASM, a processes abstraction that adapts a popular sandbox, Wasm, for microcontrollers. eWASM provides a runtime to constrain memory accesses and control flow, enabled by our aWsm Wasm compiler. We discuss and evaluate its multiple implementations that effectively trade time and space, optimizing for the constraints of embedded systems. This enables popular languages (e.g., C) to be effectively sandboxed by software. We demonstrate performance within 40% of native C on Polybench. We believe this is a practical and compelling result for many IoT domains, and it represents the first compiled sandboxing environment for microcontrollers. We show that restrictions of the current Wasm specification lead to significant memory consumption and provide suggestions for the creation of an embedded-specific Wasm variant.},

year={2008},
volume={},

pages={1-8},
abstract={Over the past few years, the Air Force Research Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico have been leading the charge to establish a new paradigm for the satellite development process. Central to this development is the space plug&play avionics (SPA) standards, which define standard electrical, data, and mechanical interfaces for all components that are used to construct the system. "Components" consist of both hardware and software elements, all capable of being integrated and tested rapidly to create functional capability. It is envisioned that with the diligence being applied, it will ultimately be possible to draw from stock items at a depot to design, assemble, and launch a satellite in a matter of days. An essential enabling aspect of the process is a collection of highly interoperable software modules, conforming to the data portion of the SPA standards, which can be selected from a library based upon their ability to collectively meet a set of prescribed mission objectives. If properly constructed, the modules can self-configure on the data network - ideally without human intervention or modification. Abolishing the segment of the satellite life cycle associated with the development of flight software is one of the most critical goals to achieve if the "six-day-satellite" concept is to become reality. Design_Net Engineering has been active in the refinement of these standards, as well as a primary contributor to the development of a flight software architecture to validate the approach. We have also created a development environment that takes advantage of the network-based data standards to allow code to be written and tested without physical hardware. This capability, termed flight software in the loop (FSWIL), utilizes a robust simulation framework to present behavioral models of hardware devices to the software developer that are indistinguishable from the actual articles. The PnPSat program is an initiative that has been established by AFRL to serve as a technology demonstration for the SPA standards. Due to the fact that many of the core technologies were being matured in parallel, it became necessary to develop the FSWIL capability to allow software efforts to progress without a supporting hardware infrastructure. The tools have important implications for the community beyond PnPSat however, as they allow developers to write and test code (or hypothetical hardware models) remotely before installing new capability in the responsive space testbed (the home of the SPA initiative). This paper will describe the FSWIL tool as well as the SPA-based flight software architecture and implementation products that support the PnPSat program.},

abstract={Advanced adaptive filters have been shown to be very powerful for tracking time varying channels in various wireless communications system. However, the performance comes at the expense of highly resource-demanding implementations, especially in the context of programmable architecture based SDR. We present the optimizations for programmable implementation of QRD based SRI-RLS, which represents a large family of advanced adaptive filters. The key contribution of our work is to comprehensively and systematically remove the redundant operations in the QRD for SRI-RLS. Although most signal processing and scientific libraries implement householder reflection based QRD, we explore different alternatives and then choose given rotations based QRD to enable the aforementioned systematic redundancy removals. Our work significantly reduces the resource requirements (cycle count, energy consumption, etc.) of SRI-RLS implementation. Comparing to the widely accepted QRD implementation in numerical recipes, our work reduces 96.4% cycle-count on a typical baseband DSP (TI TMS320C6713), enabling efficient implementations. The paper shows that removing redundancy is very effective for modern statistical signal processing algorithms that largely rely on cascaded matrix operations.},

abstract={Performing FMEA on computer software presents problems and challenges not found in FMEA of electronic hardware. Contractual directions are usually very limited or nonexistent, leaving the analyst to establish and tailor guidelines needed for a particular analysis. Where code is unavailable or off limits to the analysis, the FMEA is of limited usefulness but can still contribute to a more reliable system design. Unfortunately, many reliability analysts have more difficulty developing an approach to software analysis than doing it. An understanding of the software design process and a discussion of various approaches to software design FMEA is presented to make development of an appropriate approach and performance of the analysis itself easier to understand. Moving from the lowest level of analysis to the highest level typically from the method level to the module or package level - a FMEA becomes less accurate, less precise, and less informative, while the process becomes less difficult, less tedious, and less time-consuming. Moving from the lowest level of analysis to the highest also means a FMEA is based increasingly on the stated intent of the software designers and less on the actual product behavior. For any analysis above the code level, the analyst's conclusions about effects at each level is unfortunately be no better than the descriptions that the software designers provide.},

abstract={Software Defined Network (SDN) technology is one of the modern network virtualization technologies. When implementing a virtual network on the SDN data plane, undesired effects may occur: the appearance of undesired paths where packages can be sent, âloopingâ when the packages are infinitely cycled and infinitely cloned, duplicate paths when the host receives the same package several times. We show that these effects can occur for the joint implementation of several virtual networks even if the implementation of each separate virtual network does not cause these effects. A method for verifying the implementation of several virtual networks is proposed. A sufficient condition is established for the graph of physical connections when any set of virtual networks can be implemented without the occurrence of the above undesirable effects.},

SOA is a framework for developing an application in the enterprise system. It builds and runs on top of a web-based technology. Each service represents a business activity, and the technology supports this services via an operation known as a web-service. Meanwhile, a microservice architecture is a fine-grained of the web service. So microservice is an approach in implementation phase of a SOA. It is a bottom-up approach in application software development that is potentially used for small company and focused on a specific product. In this paper, a nanoservice is introduced as an implication of transforming a web service into microservices that yields some similarities or intersection among microservices. We showed that a nanoservice is an existence of generalization of microservices, as web service API as an example.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Programming the STI CELL processor is about successfully exploiting its potential for delivering very high performance. The purpose of this tutorial is to give the programmer practical guidelines for achieving this goal. We begin by a brief overview of the main CELL architectural features and its software development environment. Then we discuss three basic aspects of CELL programming: SPE SIMD kernel development (vectorization), SPE parallelization and intra-chip communication. We show how high performance SPE kernels are created by replacing scalar operations with vector ones, heavily unrolling loops, and exploiting dual-issue nature of the SPE architecture. We explain coding using SIMD C language extensions (intrinsics), as well as using assembly language and discuss aspects specific to code development in assembly. We present static performance analysis using the spu-timing tool. The presentation of intra-chip communication follows, with emphasis on DMA communication both for bulk data transfers as well as for synchronization. We discuss message size and alignment restrictions, enforcing of message ordering using barrier and fence mechanisms and creation of complex data transfers using DMA lists. We conclude the topic with guidelines on implementing pipelined processing with direct local store to local store communication. We discuss basic profiling techniques using the SPE decrementer. We conclude with a set of practical tips and tricks and a list of "gotchas" or common rookie mistakes. A brief overview of academic and commercial CELL programming packages follows, and a discussion of a real life example - scanning network traffic using DFA- based string matching. The tutorial ends with a presentation of techniques for programming multi-CELL systems using message passing with MPI.},

Firstly, considering avionics domain characteristics, a domain concept library is established including different types of variables and concepts. Then, a set of domain-oriented requirements templates are defined, such as: general event/condition, display event/condition, etc. According to VRM model element semantics, three types model construction algorithms are designed to complete the translation automatically. And in the case study, the Engine Indication and Crew Warning System (EICAS) was selected to show how to construct formal models from natural language requirements.},

The master and slaves also interact through shared data structures that can be modified only by the master. The Marionette runtime system is a heterogeneous remote procedure call package. It maintains the consistency of shared data structures, recovers transparently from slave processor failure, and assigns operations to slaves. The Marionette system includes tools for debugging, automated compilation of program binaries for multiple architectures, and distributing binaries to remote file systems. Measurements of a UNIX-based implementation to Marionette and a parallel ray-tracing renderer are presented.<>},

The new architecture for implementing mobile telephony base stations has the potential of offering many benefits: great cost savings by using one transceiver per base transceiver station (BTS) instead of one per channel, tremendous flexibility by moving system-specific parameters to the digital part, and allowing the support of a wide range of modulation and coding schemes. A very important problem in designing software radio applications is the need to estimate the required complexity of processing to dimension systems. For example, with a software GSM BTS it is critical to estimate the number of channels that can be supported by a given processor configuration, and to predict the impact of future processor enhancements on its capacity. This article focuses on the design of a software implementation of a GSM BTS and proposes a platform-independent evaluation of its computational requirements based on SPEC benchmarks. It focuses on the design and performance of a library of software modules. Portability and computational requirements are discussed.},

In this paper, we present an integrated hardware/software scheduling, partitioning and binding strategy. We use dynamic programming techiques to devise an optimal solution for partitioning of a given concurrent task graph which models the co-design problem, for execution on one software (single CPU) and several hardware resources (multiple FPGAs), with the objective of minimizing the total execution time. Our implementation shows that we can solve problem instances where the task graph has 40 nodes and 600 edges in less than a second.},

abstract={Hashing is an important technique to achieve high code performance in a variety of data processing applications. The concept is emphasized in Computer Science curricula, and the IT industry values graduates who can use hashing skillfully. Although several implementation details of hashing are routinely handled by software libraries, it remains the responsibility of the programmer to choose a suitable hash function (a poor hash function can degrade performance). Researchers have designed a number of generic hash functions, but environments for code development do not offer these as off-the-shelf solutions. It is also curious that textbooks and reference books do not point learners to this rich resource. Our paper remedies this deficiency by providing learners with an easy way to compare their own hash function's performance with these alternatives. Our assistive tool is an Eclipse plugin for Java programs, and we have focused only on traditional hash functions (non-cryptographic hash functions that do not preserve distance). However, our approach can be extended easily to other programming languages, development environments and hash function classes.},

abstract={Today's genome analysis applications require sequence representations allowing for fast access to their contents while also being memory-efficient enough to facilitate analyses of large-scale data. While a wide variety of sequence representations exist, lack of a generic implementation of efficient sequence storage has led to a plethora of poorly reusable or programming language- specific implementations. We present a novel, space-efficient data structure (GtEncseq) for storing multiple biological sequences of variable alphabet size, with customizable character transformations, wildcard support, and an assortment of internal representations optimized for different distributions of wildcards and sequence lengths. For the human genome (3.1 gigabases, including 237 million wildcard characters) our representation requires only 2 + 8 Â· 10-6 bits per character. Implemented in C, our portable software implementation provides a variety of methods for random and sequential access to characters and substrings (including different reading directions) using an object-oriented interface. In addition, it includes access to metadata like sequence descriptions or character distributions. The library is extensible to be used from various scripting languages. GtEncseq is much more versatile than previous solutions, adding features that were previously unavailable. Benchmarks show that it is competitive with respect to space and time requirements.},

abstract={For a long time haptic devices were expensive and therefore only accessible to a specialized community. But with companies like Novint Technologies introducing a peripheral intended to sell for about US$100, haptic devices can be expected to be affordable for a wider public. But considering that most haptic APIs are in C++, a language intended for expert programmers, novice programmers wanting to program haptic devices would face a steep learning curve. However, if the APIs were to be usable from within the .NET framework, it would allow the more novice users to program using over 20 programming languages and extensive programming solutions and therefore they would be able to easily and efficiently develop software with haptic capabilities. This paper presents a set of guidelines for a design architecture that would allow migrating an existing C++ API to the .NET framework without having to rewrite it from scratch. The presented architecture was implemented by wrapping the Sensable Ghost SDK 3.0. It was then used in both software and hardware based scenarios},

year={2021},
volume={9},

pages={18085-18111},
abstract={Cryptographic algorithms are widely used in information security fields such as network protocol authentication and commercial encryption software. Password recovery based on the hash algorithm is an important means of electronic forensics, encrypted information restoration, illegal information filtering, and network security maintenance. The traditional password recovery system is based mainly on the CPU and GPU and has a low energy efficiency ratio and cracking efficiency and cannot meet high-performance computing requirements. To further improve the computational efficiency and application flexibility of password recovery algorithms, this paper proposes a reconfigurable computing kernel design method based on a hybrid reconfigurable computing array (HRCA). Through in-depth analysis of the hash algorithm, the basic computing kernel set is extracted, and the combination design is carried out from the unit kernel, interconnection and storage structure to reconstruct the hash algorithm to match the application with the appropriate structure. Second, combined with the pipeline technology, the full pipeline hash and high-speed password attack algorithms are optimized and implemented to meet the needs of high-performance computing. Finally, an advanced computing kernel library is established, and the combination of a computing kernel map from the control and communication levels to achieve multidimensional reconfigurable computing and an overall placement strategy is used to make full use of the chip resources to improve computational efficiency. The experimental results and analysis show that compared with traditional CPU and GPU methods, the password recovery algorithm designed in this paper has the highest cracking speeds at 78.22 times and 2.65 times that of the CPU and GPU, respectively, and the highest energy efficiency ratio is 25.88 times and 3.16 times that of the CPU and GPU, respectively. Furthermore, the recovery efficiency has been significantly improved and meets the requirements of high-performance password recovery computing.},

abstract={Model-driven architecture is a well-known approach for the development of complex software systems. The most famous tool chain is provided by Eclipse with the tools of the Eclipse modeling project. Like Eclipse itself, these tools are based on Java. However, there are numerous legacy software packages written in C++, which often use only an implicit meta-model. A real C++ implementation of this meta-model would be necessary instead to be used at run time. This paper presents a generator for C++ to create the classes, meta-model packages, and factories to realize modeling, transformation, validation, and comparison of UML models. It gives an overview of its workflow and major challenges. Moreover, a comparison between Java and C++ implementations is given, considering different benchmarks.},

abstract={Application development for the Internet of Things (IoT) poses immense challenges due to the lack of standard development frameworks, tools, and techniques to assist end users in dealing with the complexity of IoT systems during application development. These challenges invoke the use of model-driven development (MDD) along with the representational state transfer (REST) architecture to develop IoT applications, supporting model generation at different abstraction levels while generating software implementation artifacts for heterogeneous platforms and ensuring loose coupling in complex IoT systems. This article proposes an IoT application development framework, named IADev, which uses attribute-driven design and MDD to address the above-mentioned challenges. This framework is composed of two major steps, including iterative architecture development using attribute-driven design and generating models to guide the transformation using MDD. IADev uses attribute-driven design to transform the requirements into a solution architecture by considering the concerns of all involved stakeholders, and then, MDD metamodels are generated to hierarchically transform the design components into the software artifacts. We evaluate IADev for a smart vehicle scenario in an intelligent transportation system to generate an executable implementation code for a real-world system. The case study experiments proclaim that IADev achieves higher satisfaction of the participants for the IoT application development and service orchestration, as compared to conventional approaches. Finally, we propose an architecture that uses IADev with the Siemens IoT cloud platform for service orchestration in industrial IoT.},

An informal survey of past graduates and potential employers in the Northern region of Tasmania indicates that prospective employers value the inclusion of a software engineering project as a vital component of the degree. The structure, management and difficulties inherent in running such a unit are discussed.

title={Design and implementation of a decentralized message bus for microservices},
year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-6},
abstract={A new software architecture, known as microservices, becomes rapidly popular recently. Microservices could help developers cope well with the problems of software complexity and demands on an adaptive development process that needs to respond to changes quickly. In this architecture, a single monolithic large application would be divided into small multiple isolated services. They are separately deployed and communicated to other services via remote calls. This architectural style allows any changes on one service not affecting the others. However, if services directly make remote calls, it would create interdependencies and tight couplings between them. To remove such problem, this paper proposes a decentralized message bus to use as a communication tool between services. Our message bus provides a framework for services to collaborate. It divides into four main components, public API, message bus, messaging and service discovery. The API uses the HTTP and RESTful style of communication. We use decentralized service discovery to avoid a single point of failure of the system. The messaging uses a simple TCP connection with only a header and body in its message. We also define three necessary communication messages for the services, viz. request/response, notification and publish/subscribe. The proposed framework is implemented and tested with a real-world scenario. It works correctly without any problem. Also, to realize how it could be scaled, we run the system continuously with incremental services and traffics. From the observation on the resource consumption of CPU, memory and network I/O, we found that the network consumption grows linearly while the CPU and memory usages have little change in consumption.},

abstract={Sensor network applications tend to exhibit significant high-level commonalities along several major dimensions that have heretofore been underexposed, particularly in the areas of collection and dissemination. We have developed a component library, Sdlib, which presents the fundamental abstractions of collection and dissemination as part of a dataflow system. This allows application developers to rapidly develop applications at the nesC level. This means that Sdlib maintains significant expressivity while operating efficiently. We have built four applications, each faithful to a mature monolithic application, on top of Sdlib to compare its performance to that of original. We find that applications implemented with Sdlib are much simpler to write, just as resource efficient, and perform comparably to monolithic implementations},

It starts from the conceptual algorithm design and computer simulation using MATLAB, Simulink, or floating-point C programs. The finite-word-length analysis using MATLAB fixed-point functions or Simulink follows with fixed-point blockset. After verification of the algorithm, a fixed-point C program is developed for a specific fixed-point DSP processor. Software efficiency can be further improved by using mixed C-and-assembly programs, intrinsic functions, and optimized assembly routines in DSP libraries. This integrated software-development process enables students and engineers to understand and appreciate the important differences between floating-point simulations and fixed-point implementation considerations and applications.},

abstract={Achieving an effective stimulation pattern for an electronic circuit card is an elusive and labor intensive task. In contrast to the vectorless testing concept which assumes nothing about the circuit card, our implementation would contain a circuit topology and a designation of devices in the circuit, including standard designation input devices, output devices, voltage and current sources, etc. A library interface is supplied to specify (when required) the safe ranges of stimulation, signal sources and analog waveforms, probe paths and if desired, an operating range and quantization of a device. As opposed to passive testing, this technique allows the tester to jump into the operating range of the device. Stimulation pattern effectiveness is measured in terms of output entropy. While the initial stimulation pattern may be selected at random, directed search techniques allow the optimization of the stimulation by eliminating redundancy, and changing existing patterns toward a stimulation pattern of increased entropy. A digital application of this concept is being developed for the Electronic Work Bench (EWB), a new VXI system using components from Talon. While a fully automatic process is not always practical, this concept should make considerable headway toward reducing to human labor cost while improving the overall process.},

The system completes the FPGA system architecture construction through the combination of software and hardware. We use the inter-frame difference method of the image R (Red) component and LK (Lucas-Kanade) pyramid optical flow method for the early image extraction and judgment, and later introduce the image processing methods such as the median filter, mean filter, Gaussian filter and grayscale processing etc., so as to realize the soft-core design and packaging of the flame recognition FPGA. Finally, the identification and boundary calibration of the flame in the video are simulated by MATLAB, and the detection process is fast and accurate. The method is realized by building FPGA and Nois II video capture system, which provides an effective solution for rapid fire identification.},
